Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC has agreed to construct a major plant in Germany, marking Europe's concerted effort to establish itself as a prominent player in the global semiconductor industry. Amidst the fierce competition between the United States and China for chip industry dominance, Europe aims to bridge the gap by investing billions. The semiconductor shortage caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent border closures in 2020 and 2021 highlighted the significance of these components in various electronic devices, from toys to smartphones and even advanced weaponry.
<br/>
Europe's strategy includes the proposed Chips Act, a legislative measure working its way through the EU's processes, with the intention of unlocking €43 billion ($49 billion) in investments from both public and private entities. The EU's objective is to secure 20 percent of global chip production by 2030, necessitating a quadrupling of its current output.
<br/>
Germany leads the European investment charge, having previously brokered deals with Intel for a €32 billion plant and other significant agreements with Wolfspeed and Infineon. France is also investing €2.9 billion in a partnership between STMicroelectronics and GlobalFoundries. Europe's stance remains somewhat fragmented, with individual countries taking their own measures. For example, the Netherlands, a key player in the sector, plans to introduce export controls to block China's access to certain technology.
<br/>
While the semiconductor industry is globally interconnected, with China producing most raw materials and Taiwan hosting major chip manufacturers, the US maintains a significant role in chip design and equipment manufacturing. The Semiconductor Industry Association reports that US firms accounted for 48 percent of the global industry, followed by South Korea with 14 percent, and Europe at nine percent.

# ***The ‘Golden Screw’ In The Semiconductor Supply Chain***

Mark Lippett, CEO of AIoT chip company XMOS, possesses over 25 years of experience in technology leadership across startup, scale-up, and established companies. The global economy's reliance on semiconductors is substantial, although the exact proportion remains difficult to quantify. The increasing interest in generative AI is just the tip of the iceberg in understanding the profound impact of semiconductors on daily life.
<br/>
Governments are concerned about securing semiconductor supply chains due to their critical role and vulnerability to malicious attacks. Some nations are attempting to onshore semiconductor production to enhance security, but this approach faces significant challenges due to the inherently global nature of the supply chain. Onshoring would require massive resources, legislative changes, and time, making it an impractical endeavor.
<br/>
A more feasible approach is for countries to specialize in specific aspects of the semiconductor industry, such as intellectual property, chip production, or technology innovation. Specialization would enable nations to have unique strengths and collaborate within a cooperative international framework.
<br/>
The Netherlands' ASML serves as a prime example of niche dominance in the semiconductor market. ASML's exceptional capabilities in photolithography make it a vital player in the global supply chain, emphasizing the potential for specialized success.
<br/>
To replicate ASML's model, businesses need funding, talent attraction, and patience. The semiconductor sector's success requires a diverse and specialized global supply chain that fosters collaboration and innovation. A globally diverse approach helps distribute risks, maintain competitiveness, and reduce overreliance on specific regions. This collaborative approach promises a more stable and prosperous legacy for future generations.

# ***Taiwan's semiconductor maker TSMC is becoming the global chipmaker it didn’t aspire to be***
<br/>
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), once highly concentrated within Taiwan, is undergoing a remarkable transformation into a globally diversified chipmaker. The company is set to open a new facility in Dresden, Germany, by 2027, adding to its already existing factories in Taiwan, China, and the United States. TSMC's expansion is motivated by the need to cater to growing demand for chips used in automobiles, prompting it to form partnerships with companies like Sony, Infineon, and NXP. This strategy deviates from TSMC's historical approach of maintaining full operational control.
<br/>
TSMC's move into various locations brings with it both challenges and benefits. The diversification dilutes the advantage of close proximity between research, development, and production but offers a global reach and access to different markets. TSMC's decision to share ownership with partners and engage with governments helps secure support and investments. However, the company's overseas ventures have not been without difficulties, as it faces regulatory, labor, and cost-related challenges in foreign locations.
<br/>
While the overseas facilities represent a notable shift, TSMC's core production remains centered in Taiwan. The expansion strategy reduces the criticism of being overly concentrated and offers stakeholders a share in the company's operations. The move signifies TSMC's adaptation to a changing industry landscape and globalization pressures.

# ***Taiwan pitches deeper Europe engagement after TSMC Germany investment***
<br/>
Taiwan's chipmaker TSMC's €3.5 billion ($3.83 billion) investment in Germany has been seen as a positive move for deeper engagement between Taiwan and Europe, according to officials from both sides. This investment also showcases Taiwan's goodwill towards Europe, even in the face of China's increasing pressure to accept its sovereignty claims over Taiwan. The European Union (EU) has not shown interest in proceeding with a Bilateral Investment Agreement (BIA) that Taiwan has sought, despite being included on the list of potential trade partners in 2015. Taiwan hopes TSMC's investment will foster closer cooperation between Taiwan and the EU, drawing parallels with the strengthening of ties between Taiwan and the United States.
<br/>
Germany views TSMC's investment as a sign of strong bilateral ties, signaling a shift from its previous stance under Chancellor Angela Merkel. The investment aligns with Chancellor Olaf Scholz's strategy to reduce economic dependence on China. Approval for the investment is expected from Taiwan's economy ministry, given that the German plant will focus on manufacturing less advanced chips for the auto industry, allowing Taiwan to allocate resources to produce more advanced chips. While TSMC's overseas expansion has raised concerns in Taiwan about losing its position in chip manufacturing, TSMC assures that its core manufacturing and research will remain in Taiwan. The investment underscores the global trend of enhancing supply chain resilience through overseas chip production.
