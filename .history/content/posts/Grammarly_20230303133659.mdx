# What is Wordtune ?
<br/>
Grammarly is a widely recognized online writing assistant tool that employs AI technology to aid in writing. It offers a Google Chrome extension and an editor that allows you to write content online. Grammarly is an all-in-one tool that can detect grammar, spelling, structure, tone, plagiarism, sentence rewriting, and more.
<br/>
The main feature of Grammarly is its grammar checker tool, which can be used by both free and premium users. The tool can identify spelling mistakes, grammar discrepancies, punctuation errors, and issues with conciseness. Mistakes are highlighted, and suggestions for correction are provided when you hover over them.
Grammarly also offers a premium-only feature called Clarity, which provides alternative sentence options for unclear sentences. The Engagement feature highlights words that have been repeated throughout the content and offers alternative synonyms for use.
The Delivery feature is linked to Goal Settings, which allows you to set specific goals for your writing or editing. You can set the intended audience, tone, domain, and purpose of your content, which will determine the suggestions you receive from the tool.
Grammarly's plagiarism tool is also a premium-only feature that allows you to check your content for plagiarism. The tool will give you a percentage of the content that matches millions of other websites online.
Additionally, Grammarly allows you to select the English language you want to use from multiple options, including American, British, Australian, and Canadian. The tool also offers official apps for iPad, iPhone, Mac, Chrome, and Android.
