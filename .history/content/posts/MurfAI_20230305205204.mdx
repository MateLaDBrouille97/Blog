# What is Murf AI ?
<br/>
Murf is a text-to-speech AI voice generator software that can create natural-sounding voiceover narrations of any written text in just a few minutes. 
It relies on an extensive library of over 120 professional voices available in 20 languages to deliver high-quality voiceover narrations that donâ€™t sound like robotic AI voices usually found in YouTube videos. 
Murf was created by Ankur Edkie, Sneha Roy, and Divyanshu Pandey, classmates from the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, in October 2020 to develop a powerful SaaS tool that could create natural-sounding speech. 
Murf has many benefits that are present in other voice-generation software, and what makes it unique are its advanced features, such as pitch control, volume and speed adjustment, teachable AI, text to speech block control, voices for all uses, and grammar assistant. 
Murf has a large and versatile target audience, including teachers and professors, content creators, businesses and marketing agencies, and anyone with basic computer skills. 
Murf offers a free trial, and its pro and enterprise plans come with a voice changer that allows users to alter their voice to make it more professional-sounding.
