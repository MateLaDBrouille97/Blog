# Mineral requirements for clean energy transitions
<br />
The demand for minerals in clean energy technologies is expected to increase significantly in the next two decades. Electric vehicles (EVs) and battery storage will account for about half of the mineral demand growth, with graphite, copper, and nickel being the dominant minerals. Solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind power will also contribute to mineral demand growth, driven by capacity additions and higher mineral intensity. The use of hydrogen in fuel cell electric vehicles and electrolysers will increase the demand for nickel, zirconium, copper, and platinum-group metals. Rare earth elements (REEs) will see significant growth in demand for EV motors and wind turbines. Clean energy technologies are set to become the fastest-growing segment of demand for most minerals, but projections are subject to uncertainty. Governments need to provide strong and consistent signals about their climate ambitions to reduce uncertainty and support the mining and processing industries.

The transition to clean energy technologies has significant implications for mineral demand. Solar photovoltaic (PV) plants, wind farms, and electric vehicles (EVs) require more minerals than traditional hydrocarbon-based energy sources. For example, an electric car requires six times the minerals of a conventional car, and an onshore wind plant requires nine times more minerals than a gas-fired plant. The shift to clean energy is expected to drive a substantial increase in mineral requirements, with renewables becoming the fastest-growing segment of demand. This increase in demand poses challenges in terms of supply availability, price volatility, and the need for diversified supply chains. Policy makers and industry stakeholders must address these challenges to ensure a smooth and sustainable energy transition.

Technology plays a crucial role in the transition towards a more sustainable and resilient world. Experts and companies engaged in this transition recognize both the potential and the limits of technology.
<br/>
Aurore Stephant, a mining engineer specialized in environmental and health risks of mineral supply chains, emphasizes the need to use technology to reduce the environmental and social impacts of mining. 
However, she also warns against the illusion of a technological fix and highlights the importance of a holistic approach that considers the entire supply chain and involves stakeholders.
<br/>
Hugues Ferreboeuf, a speaker on engineering and management of transitions, stresses the need to shift from a linear, resource-intensive economy to a circular, regenerative one. 
He advocates for the use of technology to enable this transition, but warns against the risk of rebound effects and the need to consider the entire system.
<br/>
Lionel Fournier, Director of Health and Ecology at Harmonie Mutuelle and Director of Sustainable Development at the Vyv Group, emphasizes the role of technology in improving health and well-being, for example through telemedicine or smart buildings. 
He also highlights the need to address the digital divide and ensure that technology benefits all.
<br/>
Véronique Torner, a member of the Executive Committee and administrator of Numeum in charge of the Responsible Digital program, emphasizes the need to ensure that technology is used responsibly, taking into account its environmental and social impacts. 
She advocates for the use of digital tools to enable a more sustainable and inclusive economy, but warns against the risks of data privacy and security breaches.
