EU countries, including France and Germany, have made concessions to the European Commission's green agenda following a heated political fightback. France's threat to block approval of the EU's renewable energy targets prompted the Commission to issue an additional declaration recognizing the role of nuclear energy alongside renewables in decarbonization efforts. This declaration gained support from Germany and other member states that had initially opposed including nuclear energy in the EU's renewable energy rules. The declaration acknowledges that "other sources of fossil-free energy than renewable energy contribute to reaching climate neutrality by 2050."
<br/>
Furthermore, France and Germany, among others, supported significant revisions to the European Commission's Nature Restoration Law, which aimed to protect and restore degraded ecosystems in Europe. The original proposal for each country to restore 30% of six different types of habitats by 2030 was reduced to a target of 30% across all ecosystems. The revised law grants national governments more flexibility in implementing the reforms, no longer requiring them to prevent healthy habitats from deteriorating but rather urging them to "endeavor to put in place, where possible," necessary measures.
<br/>
The controversial proposal faced opposition in the European Parliament, leading to a delay in the vote. Conservative politicians argued against the regulation, claiming it would lead to higher food prices and increased costs for farmers and fishermen. The topic became highly charged, with political groups engaging in tactics such as accusations of blackmail. The outcome of the parliamentary committee vote, scheduled for June 27, will determine the fate of the law.
<br/>
Overall, these concessions highlight the growing resistance among some EU member states against Brussels' green agenda, with concerns about the impact on investment and economic sectors like agriculture and fishing. The political tensions surrounding these issues could have implications for the implementation of key climate laws under the EU's Green Deal.
