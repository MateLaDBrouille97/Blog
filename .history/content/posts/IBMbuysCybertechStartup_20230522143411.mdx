Polar Security has developed a cutting-edge data security posture management (DSPM) platform that enables the tracking of sensitive data, identification of potential vulnerabilities and compliance violations, and offers actionable recommendations to address them. By integrating Polar Security's technology into its existing Guardium family of data security products, IBM aims to strengthen its data security solutions even further. The acquisition will see Polar Security's talented team of around 20 employees joining IBM's Guardium division in Israel.
<br/>
Founded in 2021 by industry veterans Dov Yoran (Chairman), Guy Shanny (CEO), and Roey Yaacovi (CTO), Polar Security quickly gained recognition and secured $8.5 million in a seed financing round in 2022. This acquisition aligns with IBM's strategy of continuously expanding its hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence capabilities through strategic acquisitions. IBM is already a trusted provider of advanced technology and security solutions for thousands of companies across various sectors, including finance, industry, infrastructure, transportation, and energy.
<br/>
The ever-increasing pace of digital transformation and the migration to cloud environments have resulted in the proliferation of both known and unknown data stores. This necessitates robust data security measures across multiple cloud platforms. By integrating Polar Security's technology, IBM aims to address the challenges faced by organizations that handle large volumes of data in public cloud and software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications. Managing visibility of sensitive data, access controls, and compliance in these complex environments can be a daunting task.
<br/>
This acquisition represents IBM's fifth purchase this year and follows its acquisition of Israeli startup Databand.ai in 2022, which focused on data observability software. IBM has a strong presence in Israel, with an extensive history that includes an R&D center in Tel Aviv and a research lab in Haifa. The Haifa lab, the largest IBM Research Division facility outside of the United States, is dedicated to developing innovative technological products and cognitive solutions. Their work spans various domains, including artificial intelligence, cloud data services, blockchain, healthcare informatics, image and video analytics, and wearable solutions.
<br/>
IBM's acquisition of Polar Security underscores its commitment to expanding its cybersecurity offerings and addressing the evolving needs of businesses in today's rapidly changing digital landscape. By integrating Polar Security's technology into its existing solutions, IBM aims to provide comprehensive data security solutions to its clients, reinforcing its position as a leader in the field of cybersecurity. With this acquisition, IBM takes another step toward shaping the future of secure data management in the hybrid cloud era.
