<br/>
The Council of the European Union has reached a general approach agreement on a proposal to amend the EU's electricity market design. This milestone will enable negotiations to commence with the European Parliament, with the aim of reaching a final agreement. The reform seeks to transform the electricity market in several ways:
<br/>
1. Reducing Dependency on Fossil Fuels: The reform aims to make electricity prices less reliant on volatile fossil fuel prices, thus providing consumers with more stable energy prices.
<br/>
2. Accelerating Renewable Energy Deployment: The plan includes measures to expedite the adoption of renewable energy sources, which are both cleaner and more cost-effective.
<br/>
3. Market Manipulation Protection: In addition to electricity market reforms, there is a specific focus on improving the Union's defense against market manipulation through better monitoring and transparency (REMIT).
<br/>
4. Long-Term Electricity Market Stability: The reform targets long-term electricity markets by promoting power purchase agreements (PPAs) and two-way contracts for difference (CfDs) to enhance market liquidity and predictability.
<br/>
5. Capacity Mechanisms: Capacity mechanisms, which support power plants to ensure electricity supply, are made more permanent with the introduction of a derogation for CO2 emission limits until 2028.
<br/>
6. Consumer Protection: The reform enhances consumer protection, allowing consumers to choose suppliers and access various contract options, while also imposing stricter rules on price-hedging strategies and safeguarding vulnerable customers.
<br/>
7. Affordable Energy Prices in Crises: The reform introduces measures to regulate prices for energy-poor households and small and medium-sized enterprises during times of crisis.
<br/>
The next steps involve negotiating the final legislation with the European Parliament, following which it will be formally adopted by the Council and the Parliament. This reform, initially proposed by the Commission in March 2023, represents a significant step forward for the EU, offering more stability in energy prices, reduced reliance on fossil fuels, and greater support for renewable energy sources.

# ***How to strike a grand bargain on EU nuclear energy policy***
<br/>
This paper explores the shifting dynamics of nuclear energy in the European Union, highlighting how what was once a source of unity has now become a divisive issue. It discusses the historical background of European nuclear energy, with the creation of Euratom in 1958, and how it was initially seen as a means of achieving energy independence and fostering European integration. However, the paper argues that contemporary Europe is facing challenges related to its dependence on Russian energy supplies and the urgent need for decarbonization.
<br/>
The paper proposes the idea of a "peace pact" that would allow EU member states to pursue their own energy mix without political interference. This pact would acknowledge the importance of nuclear energy in Europe's energy mix and promote a technology-neutral approach within the framework of the Green Deal and Net Zero Industrial Act. In exchange, there would be further integration of electricity markets, agreement on reform, higher renewable energy targets, and renewed research on nuclear waste management.
<br/>
The historical narrative in the paper explains how the initial enthusiasm for nuclear energy shifted due to incidents like the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl disasters and public pressure campaigns. The divide between France and Germany on nuclear energy policies grew in the late 1970s, with Germany leaning towards phasing out nuclear energy, while France continued to invest in it.
<br/>
The paper underlines the importance of overcoming the deep divisions within the EU regarding nuclear energy and recapturing the spirit of technological optimism and geopolitical commitment that initially led to the creation of Euratom.
<br/>
The paper argues that nuclear energy, despite its divisive nature, can play a crucial role in Europe's energy transition, and a "peace pact" is needed to address the current disunity and allow for progress in energy policy.

# ***EU energy ministers break deadlock on power market reform***
<br/>
EU energy ministers have broken a longstanding deadlock in their discussions over reforming the European Union's electricity market. The impasse was primarily caused by a dispute between France and Germany regarding the use of state-backed investment schemes for clean energy projects, known as Contracts for Difference (CfDs), which enable governments to recoup profits when electricity prices surge. Germany was concerned that these new rules would allow France to benefit disproportionately from its substantial nuclear power capacity, giving it a competitive advantage.
<br/>
In a compromise reached, EU energy ministers have agreed that governments can apply CfDs to investments aimed at enhancing existing power generators' capacity or extending their lifespan, as well as for future energy projects. This provision could enable France to use CfDs to prolong the operation of its older nuclear reactors. However, the compromise also includes a requirement for CfDs to adhere to specific design rules established by the European Commission, ensuring that any redistribution of revenues does not create undue distortions to competition and trade in the internal market.
<br/>
The breakthrough follows discussions between French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who met in Hamburg to resolve their differences on energy policy. The proposal will now move to inter-institutional negotiations with the European Parliament, which had already reached its own compromise position a month earlier. This development is significant in promoting cooperation and addressing the challenges faced in Europe's evolving energy landscape.

# ***France and Germany claim EU deal on electricity market a success despite unresolved nuclear questions***
<br/>
France and Germany have reached an agreement within the EU to reform the electricity market, aiming to protect consumers from the volatility of fossil fuel prices, particularly natural gas. This agreement represents a reward for the national efforts of these two countries to find common ground in the energy sector. The deal also resolves a major point of contention: the role of nuclear power in the energy mix. France successfully secured the inclusion of nuclear power in climate-friendly investment structures, while Germany insisted on the possibility of amending concessions related to this technology during the legislative process.
<br/>
The reform is seen as a positive development for European consumers, as it will lead to more stable electricity prices, preventing them from shouldering the burden of price fluctuations in fossil fuel markets. Germany's Energy Minister, Robert Habeck, hailed the agreement as a demonstration of Europe's ability to act swiftly on critical issues, ensuring affordable electricity prices for households and industries. Spain's ecological transition minister, representing the Spanish EU Council presidency, emphasized that such an agreement would have been unimaginable just a few years ago. The reform not only benefits consumers financially but also encourages the expansion of clean energy sources.
<br/>
The reform addresses the issue of gas prices significantly influencing electricity rates in Europe. It was prompted by the energy crisis in 2022, where a surge in natural gas prices led to increased power costs due to gas-fired power plants setting market rates. The proposed reform includes the introduction of long-term contracts to shield consumers from short-term price spikes, with "contracts for difference" becoming the primary government support mechanism for new power generation installations. This mechanism allows producers to pass on cost differences to the state or receive compensation based on market prices.
<br/>
The technologies eligible for support include wind, solar, hydro, geothermal, and nuclear power. Existing installations can receive funding for retrofitting, extensions, or capacity increases from the proceeds of "contracts for difference." The EU Commission is tasked with ensuring that these contracts do not distort competition. Additionally, coal and gas-fired power plants exceeding emissions standards may receive support through capacity mechanisms until the end of 2028, a point of contention, particularly for Poland.
