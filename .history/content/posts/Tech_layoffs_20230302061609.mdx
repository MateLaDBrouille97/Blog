Technology companies are increasing the pace of layoffs in 2023 due to a slowdown in
revenue growth and an uncertain global economy, with industry giants such as Amazon,
Microsoft, Google, SAP, Salesforce, and Alphabet announcing sweeping job cuts.
Although global IT spending is expected to rise this year, the increase is expected to be modest,
with data center systems and communications services predicted to grow by less than 1%.
Smaller tech firms have also been affected, with a lack of experienced tech talent causing
companies to raise salaries for IT professionals. Layoffs.fyi data shows that tech firms have
laid off 101,657 workers in the first six weeks of 2023, equivalent to 64% of total tech company
layoffs for 2022. The article provides a timeline of the most notable layoffs and the reasons
for the tech industry's turmoil.
