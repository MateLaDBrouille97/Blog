New research presented at the British Academy of Management 2023 conference suggests that consumers are equally receptive to products endorsed by AI-created models as they are to human influencers, marking the rise of AI influencer marketing. Researchers from Abbottabad University of Science and Technology in Pakistan, Dr. Abida Ellahi and Main Shakeel Ahmad, studied online videos advertising top brands on Instagram, featuring AI models like Noonoouri, LilMiquela, and Imma, comparing the comments on these AI model advertisements with those featuring human models.
<br/>
The study found that 78% of comments on AI advertisements were positive, with 17% neutral and 5% negative. In contrast, human model advertisements had figures of 75%, 19%, and 6%, respectively. The results suggest that consumers are as willing to follow AI influencers as human ones, highlighting the emergence of AI-created models as a new category of influencers in marketing.
<br/>
Ellahi also speculated that AI models could be tailored to specific target audiences for personalized marketing. While AI influencer ads offer benefits like cost-effectiveness and personalization, there are concerns about authenticity. The study suggests that a blend of human and AI models might be the most effective approach.
<br/>
This research challenges the notion that consumers find increasingly human-like AI models unsettling, emphasizing the potential for AI influencers to play a vital role in marketing, offering brands opportunities for targeted and personalized campaigns. However, it also underscores the importance of striking the right balance between human and AI influencers in marketing strategies.

# ***Samsung to Integrate Generative AI in Home Appliances for Better User Experience***
<br/>
Samsung Electronics is set to revolutionize daily living by integrating generative artificial intelligence (AI) into its home appliances. Yoo Mi-young, leader of the software development team at Samsung's digital appliances business, believes this move will transform how we interact with household electronics. Samsung aims to offer a user-centric approach to home appliances, making them more sensitive, intuitive, and environmentally conscious. This advancement goes beyond speech recognition and visual processing, intending to create appliances that better understand users' routines and preferences.
<br/>
AI-equipped kitchens will gain environmental awareness, recognizing ingredients, providing cooking suggestions, and dietary advice. Intelligent refrigerators will offer customized meal ideas and food preservation, enhancing convenience and pleasure in meal planning.
<br/>
In pursuit of energy efficiency and sustainability, Samsung is developing an energy-efficient microprocessor to ensure AI-powered appliances consume less than 0.1 watts of power over 24 hours. This aligns with the growing interest in energy conservation, especially in Europe.
<br/>
Samsung's acquisition of SmartThings, an IoT platform, underscores its commitment to innovation in the smart home sector. These generative AI-powered appliances promise to revolutionize daily activities, offering personalized assistance and eco-friendly operation. Samsung's vision paves the way for a more intelligent and interconnected future for homes, contributing to a sustainable and user-friendly living experience.

# ***OpenAI Wants to Incorporate ChatGPT in Classrooms, Releases Comprehensive Guide for Teachers***
<br/>
OpenAI is actively working to integrate its ChatGPT into educational environments, acknowledging the need for guidance to ensure its responsible use in classrooms. A new guide has been released to aid teachers in effectively utilizing ChatGPT. This guide covers various aspects, including suggested prompts, explanations of ChatGPT's functionality, its limitations, information on the effectiveness of AI detectors, and strategies for addressing potential biases.
<br/>
Educators have been exploring diverse ways to leverage ChatGPT for enhanced student learning. Examples include using it as a conversational partner for role-playing challenging conversations, creating educational materials like quizzes and lesson plans, supporting non-English speakers in translation and language practice, and teaching critical thinking by having students critically evaluate ChatGPT's responses.
<br/>
OpenAI has provided example prompts tailored to different scenarios to assist educators in initiating interactions with ChatGPT. However, it's crucial to recognize that ChatGPT may not always provide accurate information and should be used judiciously. Teachers are advised to review the output and assess its suitability for their specific classroom context.
<br/>
The integration of AI tools like ChatGPT into education has the potential to revolutionize teaching and learning. Still, concerns regarding bias, accuracy, and overreliance on AI persist in discussions surrounding this topic. OpenAI's initiative aims to empower educators with AI-driven tools while emphasizing responsible education, striking a balance between technological innovation and ethical teaching practices

# ***IBM Partners With Salesforce to Deliver AI Tools to Clients***
<br/>
IBM and Salesforce have formed a strategic partnership to advance the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI). The collaboration aims to seamlessly integrate Salesforce's suite of AI solutions, including Sales GPT, Service GPT, Salesforce Einstein, Slack GPT, and Marketing GPT, into the operations of their mutual customers. This integration will enhance customer relationship management (CRM) and redefine customer interactions, elevating business efficiency and engagement.
<br/>
IBM, leveraging its industry expertise and consultancy arm of 160,000 human consultants, will play a pivotal role in this initiative. They introduce "IBM Garage," an innovative business transformation operating model, to facilitate the integration of Salesforce's AI solutions into existing frameworks, ensuring swift and effective implementation.
<br/>
Shared clients will also have access to IBM's WatsonX enterprise AI platform, enabling them to develop and refine enterprise-grade AI models. Additionally, IBM's Data Classifier, trained on industry-specific data models, assists businesses in effectively utilizing their internal data for AI applications, revolutionizing data utilization.
<br/>
Steve Corfield, EVP and General Manager of Global Alliances and Channels at Salesforce, emphasized the transformative nature of the partnership, aiming to revolutionize customer engagement and business strategies globally. IBM's own successful use of Salesforce and WatsonX to revamp its customer service and sales processes highlights the potential for AI-driven transformation.

# ***Generative AI at an inflection point: Whatâ€™s next for real-world adoption?***
<br/>
The adoption of Generative AI (gen AI) is on the rise, especially in business applications. Walmart, for example, is deploying a gen AI app for 50,000 non-store employees, utilizing data from Walmart and third-party language models for various tasks. This trend has sparked a demand for powerful GPUs necessary for training deep learning models, leading to significant costs for companies.
<br/>
Nvidia, a leading GPU supplier, has reported strong earnings due to the gen AI wave, with startups and investors eager to obtain these chips. A partnership between Google and Nvidia further highlights the chip scarcity amid soaring demand. Nvidia's CEO believes this marks the beginning of "accelerated computing," advocating for the optimization of code for GPUs over traditional CPUs, particularly for tasks like machine learning.
<br/>
However, some experts caution against excessive enthusiasm, drawing parallels to past technology trends where machine learning was applied to everything. Not all software benefits from GPUs, and the current gen AI boom may have limitations, including hallucinations and inadequate training data.
<br/>
Despite these challenges, gen AI remains promising, driven by a shortage of workers and a growing need for automation. It is expected to reshape productivity and impact the economy positively, with reports suggesting a substantial boost in global GDP. The race for GPU dominance is just the beginning of a larger narrative in the evolving field of AI and computing, presenting both challenges and opportunities for businesses.
