SentiLink, a San Francisco-based startup founded by Naftali Harris and Maxwell Blumenfeld, has emerged as a leading player in combating synthetic identity fraud. The company's success story began when Harris and Blumenfeld, both data scientists, recognized the potential of synthetic identity fraud seven years ago. They observed that scammers were merging stolen Social Security numbers with fictitious names, creating synthetic identities to defraud banks and financial institutions.
<br/>
SentiLink's software proved effective in detecting suspicious activities related to synthetic identities. Its algorithms flagged instances where multiple Social Security numbers were associated with the same address, helping to identify fraudulent applications. The company's success caught the attention of major players in the financial industry, with seven of the top 15 U.S. banks and six of the largest credit unions becoming SentiLink's customers.
<br/>
Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a crucial role in SentiLink's operations, but the founders understand the importance of human intuition. The initial breakthrough in detecting synthetic fraud came from a human data scientist who noticed discrepancies in credit reports. SentiLink employs a team of employees dedicated to manually reviewing potential fraud attempts, while others continuously analyze cases to identify emerging patterns.
<br/>
SentiLink's revenue has seen impressive growth, reaching an estimated $25 million in the previous year, with a valuation of $430 million. The company raised $70 million in funding, enabling it to operate for the next five years without additional investment. Despite its success, SentiLink faces challenges in a rapidly evolving fraud landscape, with criminals constantly devising new schemes. Additionally, the company competes with established players like Experian and LexisNexis Risk Solutions, which offer a broader range of fraud prevention services.
<br/>
However, SentiLink's innovative approach, emphasis on human intuition, and the ability to adapt quickly to changing fraud tactics have positioned it as a key player in the fight against synthetic identity fraud. With its growing customer base and expansion into other fraud prevention areas, SentiLink is poised to make further strides in the fintech industry.

### ***Meta’s New AI Tool Makes It Easier For Researchers To Analyze Photos*** 
<br/>
Meta, the social media company formerly known as Facebook, has released an AI tool called "Segment Anything Model" (SAM) that allows users to create "cutouts" or segments of objects within images. The tool, which is browser-based and publicly available, simplifies tasks such as photo editing, surveillance footage analysis, and biological research. Meta's AI research arm, Meta AI, trained the model on a large dataset consisting of 1.1 billion segmentation masks and 11 million licensed images. The company hopes that by releasing the tool, users will build upon its capabilities for specific use cases in fields like biology and agriculture. However, the model has limitations, particularly in detecting objects with different orientations or partially covered objects. Meta sees potential for the tool's application in its virtual reality spaces and augmented reality headsets.

### ***AI’s Secret Sauce: Data, Algorithms, Skills, Or Something Else?*** 
<br/>
The article highlights the underwhelming results of many artificial intelligence (AI) projects and the reasons behind their failure. Despite the promises and hype surrounding AI, only 12% of surveyed firms have achieved superior growth and business transformation through AI. The lackluster success is attributed to executives and managers getting carried away by the promises of AI technology without focusing on the right business use cases. The secret sauce to AI success lies in selecting robust and expansive business use cases that align with the organization's objectives and justify investments in software, services, and skilled personnel. The article emphasizes the importance of visualizing, gaining business buy-in, and prioritizing these use cases to drive successful AI implementation.
