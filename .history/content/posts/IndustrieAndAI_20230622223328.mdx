Large language models like ChatGPT are expected to have a significant impact on the way people work. According to Accenture research, 40 percent of all hours worked in the United States in 2021 can be affected by these models through automation or augmentation. Tasks related to language account for 62 percent of total worked time, and 65 percent of those tasks have a high potential for automation or augmentation. However, machines will not simply replace humans, as new tasks will emerge, requiring human involvement. New roles such as prompt engineers, AI editors, and AI quality controllers will also be created. The banking and insurance sectors are predicted to be the most impacted by AI, while the chemical and natural resources sectors are expected to be least affected.

According to a report by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, three occupational groups in the United States are projected to lose jobs due to automation and other technological shifts. These groups include office and administrative support occupations, production occupations, and sales and related occupations. Cashiers are expected to see the largest drop in employment, with 335,000 fewer jobs in 2031 compared to 2021. Other jobs at risk include secretaries, office clerks, customer service representatives, word processors, typists, and parking enforcement workers. The report highlights the potential impact of automation on various occupations and emphasizes the need for workers to adapt to changing job markets.
