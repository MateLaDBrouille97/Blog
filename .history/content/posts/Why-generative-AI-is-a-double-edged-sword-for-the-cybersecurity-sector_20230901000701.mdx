The potential impact of generative AI and large language models (LLMs) on the security industry is a topic of debate. These technologies can enhance security operations by aiding in code creation, threat analysis, and team support, thereby increasing accuracy and efficiency. However, concerns arise due to their infancy and potential misuse. Responsible use is crucial, as both security professionals and adversaries recognize the potential of generative AI.
<br/>
Generative AI models like ChatGPT could revolutionize coding by assisting in application development. While not yet capable of generating code from scratch, they can produce useful starting points, allowing developers to focus on higher-level tasks. However, generative AI operates based on existing content and datasets, which attackers can exploit to create malicious code variations that evade detection. Attackers can leverage generative AI to produce variants of webshells, enabling persistence on compromised servers and evading security measures.
<br/>
Well-funded attackers can harness LLMs and AI to identify vulnerabilities and execute sophisticated exploits by analyzing source code. Open-source LLMs, lacking protection mechanisms, facilitate this behavior. Consequently, an increase in zero-day vulnerabilities and exploits is anticipated, especially as AI-generated code enters codebases without proper vulnerability scanning.
<br/>
Organizations can adopt cautious approaches to mitigate risks. Employing AI tools to scan code for vulnerabilities, similar to attacker tactics, can identify and rectify potential issues. Particularly important for code generation, organizations must validate that AI-sourced open-source code is not compromised.
<br/>
While generative AI and LLMs have the potential to enhance productivity, their use demands careful consideration and safeguards. A tech leaders' group has even called for an "AI pause" due to societal risks. Organizations should navigate these technologies thoughtfully, ensuring responsible deployment to prevent potential harm.

# ***The weaponization of AI: How businesses can balance regulation and innovation***
<br/>
<Image src="/us-economy-imf-meetings.jpg" alt="" width={700} height={650} />
<br />
The release of Forrester's "Top Cybersecurity Threats in 2023" report highlights a concerning development in the realm of cybersecurity: the weaponization of generative AI and ChatGPT by cyberattackers. This innovation enables malicious actors to enhance their ransomware and social engineering tactics, escalating risks for individuals and organizations. Even OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, has acknowledged the peril of AI-generated content and advocated for regulations to safeguard electoral integrity. However, concerns about these regulations being misused to stifle competition and consolidate power have emerged.
<br/>
OpenAI's support for regulations raises questions about intentions, particularly if established entities seek to maintain dominance by impeding newcomers through compliance burdens. Striking a balance between preventing AI-generated misinformation and fostering innovation is key. While global cooperation is crucial to tackle AI-generated misinformation's impact on elections, achieving such collaboration is challenging. Inadequate coordination leaves room for adversaries to exploit AI in influencing elections worldwide.
<br/>
Balancing AI regulation with promoting competition is essential. Governments and regulators should encourage responsible AI development without excessively constraining smaller entities. Guidelines focusing on transparency, accountability, and security can promote responsible practices. Encouraging a level playing field through access to resources, fair licensing, and partnerships can bolster competition.
<br/>
Addressing the weaponization of AI requires responsible development and global collaboration. While concerns about stifled competition due to regulations are valid, the urgency of AI safety and cooperative efforts must be acknowledged. Governments must create an environment that supports AI safety, competition, and cross-community collaboration. This approach can effectively address AI-driven cybersecurity challenges while fostering a diverse and robust AI ecosystem.

# ***How to minimize data risk for generative AI and LLMs in the enterprise***
<br/>
The adoption of generative AI by enterprises for innovation and productivity has been tempered by concerns about security, privacy, and governance risks associated with publicly hosted large language models (LLMs). Pushing sensitive and proprietary data into such models could potentially expose valuable information or make it vulnerable to hackers. To harness the benefits of LLMs while managing these risks, companies are advised to adopt several strategies.
<br/>
Firstly, instead of sending data out to LLMs, the recommendation is to bring LLMs to the organization's secure data environment. This approach ensures that the LLMs are hosted and deployed within the existing security perimeter, allowing data teams and employees to interact with them without compromising sensitive information.
<br/>
Secondly, building domain-specific LLMs tailored to the organization's needs is highlighted as a more effective strategy. While widely-trained LLMs can introduce biases and inaccuracies, customizing models to align with the organization's data and objectives enhances accuracy and relevance. Models like ChatGPT, StarCoder, and StableLM are among the options that can be downloaded, customized, and used within the organization's firewall.
<br/>
Thirdly, optimizing LLMs for specific use cases in the enterprise reduces resource requirements and increases efficiency. Tuning models with internal data that employees trust yields higher-quality results. Additionally, organizations should leverage natural language processing to extract insights from unstructured data formats like emails, images, and videos, enabling the creation of multimodal AI models that can uncover valuable relationships.
<br/>
Lastly, enterprises are advised to approach generative AI adoption deliberately and cautiously. While embracing the technology's potential for industry disruption, businesses should carefully evaluate model providers, scrutinize guarantees, and strike a balance between risks and rewards. By keeping generative AI models within the secure perimeter of their own data and utilizing customization, businesses can fully capitalize on the advantages of this emerging technology.

# ***Salesforce survey flags AI trust gap between enterprises and customers***
<br/>
The shift towards integrating large language models (LLMs) into various sectors to enhance efficiency and customer experiences has been swift, yet a "trust gap" has emerged, as indicated by a recent Salesforce survey. Conducted between May and July 2023, the survey involved over 14,000 consumers and business buyers across 25 countries, revealing that despite a general willingness to embrace AI for better experiences, a significant number of respondents lack trust in companies to ethically implement AI.
<br/>
The concept of trust in AI is intricate and multifaceted, encompassing factors such as ethical adherence, privacy, and non-discrimination. While 76% of respondents trust companies' product claims, nearly 50% expressed distrust in their ethical use of AI. Key concerns included transparency and a human validation process for AI outputs, both demanded by over 80% of respondents. Only 37% believed AI could offer responses as accurate as humans.
<br/>
Business buyers displayed more optimism towards AI (73%) compared to consumers (51%). Interestingly, this optimism has diminished since 2022, despite the introduction of generative AI capable of rapid content creation. In 2022, 82% of business buyers and 65% of consumers were open to AI usage for improved experiences.
<br/>
The survey suggests steps for companies to regain trust. Transparency and human validation were paramount, with over half of respondents asserting this would boost their confidence. 49% advocated for consumer control over AI application, while 39% called for third-party ethics review, and 36% sought government oversight. Additional measures included industry standards, customer feedback integration, diverse dataset training, and public algorithm availability.
<br/>
Despite the inevitability of AI implementation to remain competitive, addressing these concerns is crucial. Leading with ethical values and responsible AI use will likely drive future success, according to Michael Affronti, SVP and GM for Salesforce Commerce Cloud. The survey underscores the importance of reconciling the enthusiasm for AI's potential with the need for ethical and transparent implementation, especially considering diverse customer perspectives.
