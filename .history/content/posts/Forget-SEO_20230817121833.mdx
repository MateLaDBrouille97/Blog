The VB Transform 2023 conference featured Jeremiah Owyang, an industry analyst, discussing the impending disruption of traditional advertising and SEO due to the rise of personal AI agents. Owyang believes that AI agents and foundational models will replace traditional search engines, leading to a shift in marketing strategies. Advertisers will now pay to have their messages included in AI-generated responses, potentially introducing "sponsored sentences" or ads alongside AI-generated content. Marketers must transition from optimizing search engines to optimizing for AI platforms to ensure their content is discovered.
<br/>
Owyang predicts that as more consumers use AI tools like GPT for information, traditional web crawling methods will become inadequate. He emphasizes the importance of having AI agents trained on a brand's data to ensure visibility in AI-driven environments. The concept resembles SEO strategies, but now extended to AI agents.
<br/>
The idea of personal AI agents aligns with Bill Gates' vision, and companies like Inflection AI are already developing such agents. Owyang envisions a future where brands utilize autonomous agents to interact with consumers' AI agents, revolutionizing how products are recommended, negotiated, and purchased.
<br/>
Owyang introduces the concept of AI Engine Optimization, which involves creating APIs for real-time information exchange with foundational models. This strategy aims to shape AI behaviors rather than just influencing human decision-making. As businesses gear up for this AI-driven future, Owyang calls on marketers to be prepared for this paradigm shift in advertising and interaction.

# ***How FraudGPT presages the future of weaponized AI***
<br/>

<br />
The discovery of FraudGPT, a subscription-based AI tool for generating malicious cyberattacks, has raised concerns about the democratization of weaponized generative AI for cyberattacks. FraudGPT was found circulating on the dark web's Telegram channels by Netenrich's threat research team in July 2023. It offers features like automated creation of malicious code, undetectable malware, and convincing phishing emails, making advanced attack methods accessible even to inexperienced attackers.
<br/>
Leading cybersecurity vendors, including CrowdStrike, IBM Security, and Palo Alto Networks, have warned that the weaponization of generative AI started before ChatGPT's release in November 2022. While this AI advancement accelerates attack volume, the quality of attacks might not significantly change, according to experts.
<br/>
Sven Krasser from CrowdStrike emphasizes the importance of cloud-based security using AI to counter these evolving threats effectively. FraudGPT's subscription model could potentially outpace even large nation-state cyberattack armies, increasing intrusion attempts, especially on softer targets like education and healthcare.
<br/>
FraudGPT highlights the future challenges posed by AI-driven cyberattacks, including automated social engineering, AI-generated malware, discovering cybercrime resources, evasion of defenses, and difficulty in detection and attribution. As weaponized generative AI continues to develop, cybersecurity efforts must evolve to maintain resilience against these emerging threats.
<br/>
FraudGPT marks the beginning of a new era in the proliferation of weaponized AI tools, demanding a proactive approach to cybersecurity to stay ahead in this rapidly evolving landscape.

# ***How new AI demands are fueling the data center industry in the post-cloud era***
<br/>
<Image src="/annevb_artificial_intelligence_and_technology_putting_pressure_1ace7081-0d3c-4538-8525-4aeb0eb8b527.jpeg" alt="" width={600} height={500} />
<br />
The transition into the "AI Era" brings about a surge in data center industry growth, marked by increased artificial intelligence (AI) usage. This shift follows the "Cloud Era," driven by cloud and mobile platforms, where significant data center capacity growth was facilitated by major public cloud service providers and internet content companies. However, recent shifts have led to rising financing costs, build times, and power constraints in key markets.
<br/>
The AI-driven demand has brought about changes in data center strategies. Customers are now willing to sign larger deals, especially in markets with available power, and are open to leasing capacity at higher prices in constrained markets. This evolution in customer behavior necessitates adjustments to traditional models and expectations.
<br/>
Hyperscale buyers, traditionally reliant on self-building data centers, are increasingly leasing capacity from third parties to enhance market speed. This changing strategy requires a more diverse approach, encompassing both self-built and leased capacity, leading to potential market shifts and migration risks.
<br/>
AI's power-hungry nature demands innovative cooling solutions, such as liquid cooling, as power density requirements surge in data centers. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors also come into play, with a focus on sustainability through energy efficiency, renewable energy usage, water conservation, and waste reduction.
<br/>
The advent of AI plugins, such as those from OpenAI, introduces the potential for new data center ecosystems centered around specific industries. In this landscape, identifying high-value customers and developing the right products and infrastructure become crucial for success.
<br/>
To thrive in this new era, the data center industry must develop adaptable strategies to navigate AI-driven demand. Flexible data center infrastructure strategies that leverage AI's potential are essential for sustained growth and success.

# ***DataRobot now covers entire generative AI lifecycle for enterprises***
<br/>
Boston-based startup DataRobot is enhancing its AI platform with new generative AI capabilities and applied services. The company's platform assists enterprise AI development and is now focused on providing an open and comprehensive solution for teams to experiment with, build, deploy, and monitor AI assistants using generative AI. This move comes at a crucial time when businesses are seeking to harness the potential of AI to drive impact.
<br/>
DataRobot's chief customer officer, Jay Schuren, emphasized the increasing demand for generative AI solutions among businesses to gain a competitive advantage. However, there are challenges in moving quickly to deploy these solutions into production. Common hurdles include selecting the right problems to solve, handling ecosystem lock-in, managing models and databases, ensuring last-mile usability, and establishing trust in AI outputs.
<br/>
To address these challenges, DataRobot is expanding its platform's capabilities. It enables users to create end-to-end generative AI solutions, integrate predictive AI models into pipelines for auditing generative outputs, and assess and monitor various metrics like truthfulness and toxicity. The platform also offers a Streamlit Application Sandbox to facilitate rapid prototyping, building, and deployment of applications.
<br/>
In addition to the technical enhancements, DataRobot provides applied AI services. These services include training for generative AI proficiency, ideation and roadmapping support, and a trust and compliance framework to ensure responsible AI development in accordance with regulations.
<br/>
The new generative AI capabilities and services are available immediately, with organizations like Baptist Health South Florida and FordDirect already testing them in pre-launch stages.
