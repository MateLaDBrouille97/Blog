During the lifecycle of a page-to-page routing action, Next.js lets you listen to a variety of events. 
For example, routeChangeStart() is fired when a route changes (like clicking a link) and routeChangeCompleted() is fired when the routing is finished (like the new page is completely loaded).
Getting these events and using them to show/hide components (for example a loaded) is the way to Next.js transitions.

I assume your **Next.js Project** is already set
