<br />
The rise of AI, with ChatGPT leading the way, has become a noticeable force in areas traditionally dominated by humans—like reading comprehension, speech recognition, and image identification.
<br/>
As shown in the chart, AI has not only caught up but also surpassed human performance in several domains, with a trajectory to outperform humans in others.
<br/>
The method to evaluate this progress involves comparing AI performance against benchmarks set by human and AI capabilities. These benchmarks range from 0%, representing the AI's best performance at the time of dataset creation, to 100%, denoting human-level performance. Tracking the progress on this scale illustrates how AI models are gradually approaching human proficiency.
<br/>
The table illustrates when AI began matching human performance across eight skills. Notably, substantial progress has occurred since 2010, particularly in databases like SQuAD, GLUE, and HellaSwag that emerged post-2015.
<br/>
Several factors have contributed to AI's rapid advancement. Enhanced computing power, expansive data availability, and improved algorithms have made AI models faster, smarter, and more efficient than ever before. Consequently, AI language models have started to outperform humans in standardized tests.
<br/>
Nevertheless, the challenge lies in translating this success to real-world scenarios. Although AI surpasses benchmark tests, it occasionally falters in practical applications.
<br/>
Anticipated advancements in computing and algorithms imply that this swift progress will likely persist. Yet, a potential impediment could be the scarcity of quality training data rather than limitations within AI itself.

# ***Nvidia vs. AMD vs. Intel: Comparing AI Chip Sales***
<br/>
<Image src="/Nvidia-vs-AMD-vs-Intel_AI-Chip-Sales.jpg" alt="" width={700} height={650} />
<br />
Nvidia has emerged as a frontrunner in the surge of generative AI, achieving record revenue in Q2 and attributing a significant portion to AI chip sales. Comparing Nvidia's AI chip sales to American rivals AMD and Intel reveals Nvidia's remarkable dominance. While the exact revenue from AI chips isn't disclosed, insights can be drawn from Data Center segment earnings. This sector encompasses GPUs, CPUs, and DPUs, with GPUs being favored for AI due to their parallel processing capabilities. Nvidia's Data Center revenue has quadrupled in the last two years, securing over 70% of the AI chip market share. This success results from early recognition of the AI trend and offering comprehensive solutions.
<br/>
In contrast, AMD lags with slower growth and lesser revenue. Although its MI250 chip is 80% as fast as Nvidia's A100, AMD is making strides with the MI300X chip boasting 192GB memory, potentially challenging Nvidia. Intel, historically strong in traditional CPUs, struggles in AI. Its attempts have been plagued by issues, including delays for the Sapphire Rapids processor. Despite this, all three companies aim to expand their AI offerings, as evident from ChatGPT's operation on thousands of Nvidia A100 chips. With increasing AI model development, the underlying infrastructure presents substantial revenue prospects.

<br />
Graphene, a remarkable two-dimensional material, has transitioned from a laboratory curiosity to a transformative force in technology and manufacturing. This infographic, sponsored by HydroGraph, delves into graphene's standout qualities, diverse applications, and promising commercial trajectory.
<br/>
The Graphene Council's survey reveals industry stakeholders prioritize its exceptional properties: electrical and thermal conductivity, electrical charge storage, impact resistance, tensile strength, corrosion resistance, and more. These attributes give graphene a competitive advantage and fuel its rapid demand growth.
<br/>
Graphene comes in various forms, including graphene oxide, nanoplatelets, and mono/bilayer graphene. Predictions by Global Market Insights indicate graphene oxide will dominate with a 44.3% market share by 2030, followed by nanoplatelets (32.7%), and mono/bilayer graphene (14.5%).
<br/>
Graphene's journey to commercialization is marked by milestones: from sporadic study attempts in 1859 to mass production and incorporation into consumer products by 2014. Notably, Ford integrated graphene-enhanced materials in vehicles in 2019, and a graphene-enabled solar farm was established in 2020. The projected timeline includes full commercial adoption across industries by 2025 and displacement of legacy materials by 2030.
<br/>
To prevent shortages by 2033, Research and Markets stress the need to balance supply and demand through increased production capacity. HydroGraph, with patented eco-friendly technology, aims to produce over 10 tons of ultra-pure graphene within three months. The infographic encourages exploring investment opportunities with HydroGraph for those interested in graphene's potential.
