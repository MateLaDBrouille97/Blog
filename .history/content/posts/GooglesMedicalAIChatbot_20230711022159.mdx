Google has been testing Med-PaLM 2, an AI tool designed to provide answers to medical questions, at the Mayo Clinic research hospital and other institutions since April. Med-PaLM 2 is a version of PaLM 2, which was introduced at Google I/O in May. It serves as the language model behind Google's Bard. The tool aims to be particularly useful in countries with limited access to doctors. Med-PaLM 2 was trained on a curated dataset of medical expert demonstrations, making it more suitable for healthcare conversations compared to general chatbots like Bard, Bing, and ChatGPT.
<br/>
Although Med-PaLM 2 still faces some accuracy issues commonly found in large language models, it performed similarly to actual doctors in various metrics such as evidence of reasoning, consensus-supported answers, and correct comprehension. The tool is in its early stages of development, according to Google senior research director Greg Corrado. While Corrado wouldn't personally include it in his family's healthcare journey, he believes Med-PaLM 2 expands the areas in healthcare where AI can be beneficial by a significant margin.
<br/>
Customers participating in the Med-PaLM 2 testing will have control over their encrypted data, and Google will not have access to it. The tool's potential to improve healthcare access and information availability is promising, but further development and refinement are necessary. Google's Med-PaLM 2 represents an effort to leverage AI to address the challenges of limited access to medical expertise and provide reliable medical information to users worldwide.

### ***For better or worse, Apple is avoiding the AI hype train***
<br/>
During Apple's WWDC conference, the company notably avoided using the term "AI" and instead emphasized "machine learning" to describe its technological advancements. Apple has long been cautious about associating itself with the buzzword AI and prefers to focus on the functionality that machine learning provides to users. While other tech giants like Google and Microsoft have fully embraced AI, Apple's approach aligns with its hardware-centric business model, prioritizing user experience and selling devices rather than reinventing search or productivity software. However, Apple may be missing out in one area: Siri, which has been criticized and lags behind AI language models.

### ***Google confirms it’s training Bard on scraped web data, too***

Google updated its privacy policy to disclose that its AI services, including Bard and Cloud AI, may be trained on publicly scraped web data. The policy states that Google uses this information to improve its services and develop new products, but it does not specify how copyrighted materials will be prevented from being included. The update raises questions about data usage compliance with regulations like GDPR and the fair use doctrine. Gannett, the largest newspaper publisher in the US, is suing Google, alleging a monopoly in the digital ad market. Twitter and Reddit have also implemented measures to prevent data harvesting.
