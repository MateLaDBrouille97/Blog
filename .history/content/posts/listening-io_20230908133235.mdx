Listening.io is a Chrome extension designed to facilitate the conversion of academic papers, PDFs, web pages, and emails into audio format, making it convenient for users to listen to content instead of reading. It is equipped to handle complex elements like math equations, remove in-line citations, and decode technical jargon from various fields. Additionally, its mobile app offers functionalities such as quick section navigation and one-click note-taking.
<br/>
Created on July 18, 2022, Listening.io was available as a Chrome extension until its removal from the Chrome Web Store on July 18, 2023. While it received mixed user feedback, some users praised its potential and quick customer support for resolving issues and processing refunds.

Users provided suggestions for improvement, including skipping URLs during reading, displaying ongoing uploads, utilizing GPT-3 for quick article summaries, and expanding voice options for a more realistic listening experience.
<br/>
Regarding privacy, Listening.io was deemed safe to use, as it did not request sensitive permissions. However, there were some concerns about trustworthiness, and users were advised to exercise caution when installing it, unless they fully trusted the publisher.

Listening.io aimed to enhance accessibility by converting written content into audio, though it faced challenges and mixed reviews, but with potential for future improvements.
