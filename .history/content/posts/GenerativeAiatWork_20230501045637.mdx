A recent study conducted by researchers from Stanford and MIT, Erik Brynjolfsson, Danielle Li, and Lindsey Raymond, explores the impact of generative AI-based conversational assistants on customer support agents and their productivity. The study analyzed data from 5,179 customer support agents who were given access to a tool designed to assist them in resolving customer issues more efficiently by providing suggestions for responses based on previous interactions with customers.

Generative AI-based conversational assistants had a positive impact on experienced and highly skilled workers, but to a lesser extent. The authors suggest that this may be due to experienced workers already possessing tacit knowledge that is not easily captured by the AI model. Nonetheless, the introduction of AI systems can have a positive impact on the experience and organization of work, reducing turnover and improving customer satisfaction. Customers treated agents more positively when they received assistance from the AI model, as measured by the sentiments of their chat messages.

The study highlights the potential for augmentation, where humans work alongside machines to improve outcomes, rather than job displacement due to automation. The authors emphasize that while there are concerns about job displacement due to automation, this study shows that there are also opportunities for augmentation where humans work alongside machines to improve outcomes.

Generative AI-based conversational assistants can improve productivity and customer sentiment in customer support settings. The tool is particularly beneficial for novice and low-skilled workers, but experienced workers also benefit from its use. The study demonstrates that the introduction of AI systems can have a positive impact on the organization of work, reducing turnover and improving customer satisfaction. The findings show the potential for augmentation, where humans work alongside machines to improve outcomes, rather than job displacement due to automation.
