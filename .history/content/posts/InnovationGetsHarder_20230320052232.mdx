The research paper titled "Are Ideas Getting Harder to Find?" examines the challenges of generating new ideas and innovations in various domains. 
The authors note that although growth has been steady, the number of human minds required to achieve that growth has multiplied over the past few decades. 
This suggests that it is becoming more difficult to generate new ideas and innovations.
The authors analyze the case of Moore's Law, which has shown consistent progress at 35% per year, but the effective number of researchers has grown almost 20-fold since 1971. 
They also examine the progress in agriculture, where the increase in annual yields across major crops has been consistent for half a century, but the gains are costing more and more. 
Similarly, the progress in machine learning has not yielded any visible increase in the growth rate of progress, despite increased research efforts.
The authors use the number of patents issued as a measure of innovation and find that more R&D effort has been matched by more patenting. 
However, in recent years, patenting has increased faster than R&D effort, indicating that innovation is becoming more challenging.
Finally, the authors consider total factor productivity (TFP), a measure of progress for entire industries or economies. 
They find that TFP has shown a decline in productivity over the years, suggesting that it is becoming more challenging to generate new ideas and innovations.
In conclusion, the authors' research suggests that generating new ideas and innovations is becoming increasingly difficult, as more R&D effort is required to achieve technological advancement across various domains. 
This has significant implications for future economic growth and the sustainability of our current technological trajectory.
