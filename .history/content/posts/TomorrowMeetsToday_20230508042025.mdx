In the 1950s, General Motors' promotional film, Design for Dreaming, showcased a vision of a future where push-button magic would free humans from the drudgery of domestic work. However, the article contends that what freed upper-middle-class women from domestic work was their entry into the workforce, not automation. Furthermore, the idea that automation would put an end to work now seems less like a promise than a threat.

The article explores the idea of the “surplus population” and the solutions for those whose jobs are better performed by machines. Should they be supported, or should measures be taken? The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies sets out a dualistic picture of the future, with both an upside and a downside. However, the underlying assumption in the dominant automation story that isn’t addressed is that automation is accelerating economic productivity, which is not necessarily the case.
<br/>
Despite experiencing real material changes brought about by digital automation, we're not seeing the exponential takeoff in productivity that we were promised. Instead, there are signs of stagnation across the developed world. The reasons for this stagnation are complex, and economists disagree about what’s to blame. One reason is that developed economies have deindustrialized.
<br/>
While automation may seem like a panacea for reducing human labor, the reality is more complex. Automation isn't necessarily increasing economic productivity, and the promised future of a world without work may be more of a threat than a promise. We need to consider solutions for those whose jobs are better performed by machines, and we need to address the underlying assumptions about the benefits of automation.
