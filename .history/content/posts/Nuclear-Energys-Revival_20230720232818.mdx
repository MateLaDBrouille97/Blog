The US state of Georgia has taken a remarkable initiative to tackle climate and energy challenges by constructing the first new nuclear power plant in the country in decades. This decision seems ironic, considering that Georgia native President Jimmy Carter contributed to the decline of the US civilian nuclear energy industry due to his response to the Three Mile Island nuclear disaster and ineffective energy policies.
<br/>
Despite the potential benefits of nuclear power, Georgia's nuclear renaissance faced significant obstacles. The project was delayed by seven years and went over budget by $17 billion due to difficulties in offsite prefabrication and bureaucratic delays. Worldwide, nuclear power has been hampered by bureaucratic paralysis, policymakers' shortsightedness, and public stigmas, leading countries like Germany to phase out nuclear energy in favor of polluting fossil fuels.
<br/>
However, there is hope for a new generation of nuclear technology to reverse this trend. Geopolitical and geoeconomic incentives, prompted by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and China's nuclear power expansion, have increased the support for nuclear energy as a clean and diversified energy source.
<br/>
Innovation has given rise to promising technologies, such as NuScale Power's modular reactors and Westinghouse's downsized AP300 nuclear reactor. These advancements aim to address market demands and environmental concerns associated with nuclear power. Smaller reactors are favored for their increased return on investment, easier integration into existing grids, and smoother regulatory processes.
<br/>
Despite these technological advancements, challenges remain, especially in combating NIMBYism (Not In My Backyard) and bureaucratic inefficiencies that have hindered nuclear projects in the past. Western governments must rally public support, reform regulatory frameworks, and collaborate with foreign stakeholders to ensure stable supplies of nuclear fuel and promote international regulatory standards.
<br/>
While supportive policies and investments are being made to diversify energy sources, regulatory support and reforms are essential to fully capitalize on the potential of nuclear energy. The danger lies in succumbing to public misunderstandings and bureaucratic obstacles, which could hinder the path towards a cleaner and more sustainable energy future.

### ***How Old Are the World’s Nuclear Reactors?***
<br/>

<br />
As of March 2023, there are 422 nuclear reactors operating worldwide, with an age distribution as follows:
<br/>
- 67 reactors are between 0 to 10 years old, accounting for 18% of global nuclear electrical capacity.
- 29 reactors are between 11 to 20 years old.
- 46 reactors are between 21 to 30 years old.
- 155 reactors are between 31 to 40 years old.
- 107 reactors are between 41 to 50 years old.
- 18 reactors are over 50 years old, with the oldest ones being 54 years old and entering service in 1969.
<br/>
The majority of the world's nuclear reactors (about 62%) began operating between 1973 and 1992, driven by a building boom in nuclear power during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. However, growth in nuclear power slowed down in the 21st century due to decreasing public support and safety concerns.
<br/>
Nuclear reactors are typically designed to last for 20 to 40 years, but they can operate beyond their initial licensed periods with lifetime extensions. Some countries have granted license renewals for aging reactors, with 88 out of 92 reactors in the U.S. approved to operate for up to 60 years, and some even applying for additional 20-year extensions to operate for up to 80 years. With safety concerns addressed, reactors with lifetime extensions can offer advantages, as they can produce carbon-free electricity at low and competitive costs without the need for significant capital investments in new reactors, aligning with global efforts to decarbonize the power sector.

### ***le gouvernement polonais donne son feu vert à la première centrale du pays***
<br/>
The development of nuclear power in Australia faces three main arguments: cost, safety, and renewability. While nuclear power relies on uranium, which is not renewable, its abundance makes it practically inexhaustible. The focus should thus be on safety and economics.
<br/>
Concerns about nuclear safety are valid, considering past disasters like Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima. However, failing to consider nuclear as an option might lead to reliance on coal plants if the transition to solar, wind, and batteries faces delays in infrastructure upgrades. Additionally, the emerging scientific consensus suggests that small modular reactors (SMRs) could provide a safer alternative to traditional large-scale nuclear plants.
<br/>
Regarding economics, Energy Minister Chris Bowen claims nuclear power is not viable for Australia, especially during an energy cost crisis. However, the author argues that removing the ban on nuclear energy would allow the market to decide its feasibility. Bold investors might invest in SMRs, utilizing Australia's vast uranium reserves and repurposing decommissioned coal-fired power plants. The hope is that, like PCs were to mainframes, SMRs could achieve cost reductions and efficiency improvements over time.
<br/>
Nonetheless, the author urges continued investment in renewables and upgrades to the transmission system. A blanket ban on nuclear energy precludes open-minded exploration of all options for achieving net-zero emissions. The climate crisis demands both renewables and nuclear power, not an either/or approach.
<br/>
Despite the risks associated with nuclear power, the urgent need to address the climate crisis requires a comprehensive examination of all feasible options, including nuclear energy, alongside renewables. The decision should prioritize safety, economics, and sustainability to create a diversified and robust energy mix for a sustainable future.
