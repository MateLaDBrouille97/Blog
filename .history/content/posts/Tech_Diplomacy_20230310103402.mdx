The intersection of technology and international relations involves a complex array of terms, including e-diplomacy, cyber diplomacy, digital technology, tech diplomacy, and more. Such a vast array of closely related terms has led to confusion among experts in the field.
The concept of diplomacy has transcended its traditional, Westphalian view as something exclusively applicable to interstate relations. Today, diplomacy is a vital tool in managing diverse relationships between various actors in the international arena.
E-diplomacy relies heavily on information and communication technologies (ICT) tools, such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Linkedin, and other digital platforms, to enhance its effectiveness and address the needs of the diplomatic service and government.
Cyber diplomacy pertains to the domain of cybersecurity and cyber warfare, including developing cyber norms, capacity-building, and confidence-building measures.
Digital diplomacy encompasses both practical applications of ICT tools by diplomats and topics related to technology and international relations.
Tech diplomacy has a more comprehensive scope, incorporating both digital and cyber diplomacy, and aims to open a dialogue between state and non-state players in the technology industry.
Technology diplomacy encompasses conducting international relations, dialogue, and negotiations on global digital policy and emerging technological issues among states, private sectors, civil society, and other groups.
As we head towards the future, new technologies are set to transform everything in the coming decades. While technological advancements may alter the character of diplomacy, they cannot change its core essence - peaceful relations among international actors through negotiation, cooperation, or any other peaceful means.
