The mass-exploitation of the MOVEit Transfer software has become the largest hack of 2023, impacting over 1,000 organizations, with 60 million individuals affected. The breach was initiated in May when a zero-day vulnerability was disclosed in MOVEit Transfer, a managed file transfer service by Progress. This vulnerability enabled the Clop ransomware group to infiltrate servers and steal sensitive data. The attacks and threats to release stolen data if not paid have continued since then.
<br/>
US-based organizations account for 83.9% of victims, while Germany, Canada, and the UK follow with smaller percentages. Major victims include Maximus (11 million individuals), the French government's unemployment agency (10 million), and several state departments in the US.
<br/>
Around one-third of vulnerable MOVEit servers belonged to financial service entities, while healthcare, IT, and government/military sectors were also affected. The estimated cost of the breach is approximately $10 billion, with some experts suggesting it could be much higher.
<br/>
Notably, Clop might have had the MOVEit exploit as far back as 2021. The US State Department offered a $10 million reward for information on the Clop group, and the group reportedly earned around $100 million from victims who paid ransoms.
<br/>
Clop claimed to delete all government-related data but hasn't provided evidence for this. The hack underscores the escalating threats posed by ransomware groups, their potential financial gains, and the severe challenges organizations face in securing their digital infrastructure.

# ***Forever 21 data breach affects half a million people***
<br/>

<br />
Clothing retailer Forever 21 has disclosed a data breach that impacted over half a million individuals, according to a notice filed with Maine's attorney general. The breach occurred over a three-month period starting in January 2023, during which hackers accessed files from the company's systems. The compromised data included personal information of both current and former employees. Forever 21's spokesperson, Lorena Terroba Urruchua, confirmed that the breached data encompassed details such as names, dates of birth, bank account numbers, Social Security numbers, and information related to employees' health plans, including enrollment and premiums.
<br/>
The notice didn't provide extensive details about the incident, only stating that unauthorized access to the systems had occurred. However, it mentioned that the company had taken measures to prevent the unauthorized party from accessing the data further. The wording of the notice raised questions about whether a ransom might have been paid to the hackers in exchange for data deletion, a tactic often employed by ransomware groups. This approach has raised doubts in the cybersecurity community due to the uncertainty of whether threat actors genuinely delete stolen data after receiving payment.
<br/>
This isn't the first breach for Forever 21; it previously suffered a major data breach in 2017, involving the theft of credit card numbers from its point-of-sale machines. The recent breach impacts current and former employees, not customers. The incident's timing is notable as it comes shortly after a partnership announcement between Forever 21 and retail giant Shein, involving mutual customer access and an acquisition deal. It remains unclear whether news of the data breach will impact this partnership. Forever 21 has declined to provide further comments regarding the breach.

# ***LogicMonitor customers hit by hackers, because of default passwords***

<br />
Network security company LogicMonitor experienced a security breach resulting in the hacking of some of its customers due to the use of default passwords, as reported by TechCrunch. A spokesperson for LogicMonitor acknowledged the incident and confirmed that it has impacted a limited number of customers. The company is actively working with these affected customers to manage the situation and minimize the impact of the breach.
<br/>
The breach occurred because LogicMonitor had been assigning default passwords, such as "Welcome@" followed by a short number, to its customers until recently. This security flaw allowed unauthorized access to the customers' accounts and systems. Initially, the default passwords were not required to be changed, but the company has now implemented a policy where the setup password must be changed upon the first login and is valid for 30 days.
<br/>
One of LogicMonitor's customers received proactive communication from the company regarding a possible breach that could compromise monitored systems with ransomware attacks. While details about the breach are limited, LogicMonitor's spokesperson did not share more information about the incident.
<br/>
The breach has reportedly affected at least one company that lost over 400 systems due to a ransomware attack exploiting the weak default passwords. LogicMonitor provides a software-as-a-service platform that monitors network infrastructure, including cloud-based systems. The company boasts over 100,000 software users across multiple countries and monitors an extensive number of metrics daily.
<br/>
The breach highlights the importance of strong password practices and proactive security measures to prevent unauthorized access and potential ransomware attacks. The incident also underscores the potential risks associated with default passwords, which can be exploited by malicious actors if not promptly addressed.

# ***Mom’s Meals says data breach affects 1.2 million customers***
<br/>
<Image src="/gettyimages-517500435.jpeg" alt="" width={700} height={650} />
<br />
Mom’s Meals, a meal delivery service catering to individuals with chronic health conditions, has suffered a data breach impacting over 1.2 million people. Parent company PurFoods confirmed the breach in a notification to Maine's attorney general. The cyberattack occurred between January 16 and February 22 and resulted in the encryption of certain files. The presence of data theft tools on the network suggests ransomware as a likely cause. It's uncertain if data was exfiltrated, but PurFoods cannot rule out the possibility. A third-party incident response firm investigated and found that compromised files contained personal and protected health information.
<br/>
The breach affects recipients of Mom’s Meals packages, including Medicare and Medicaid members, as well as self-paying individuals and those ineligible for government assistance. Employees, former employees, and independent contractors were also impacted. The exposed information includes customer names, Social Security numbers, driver's license details, financial account data, medical records, health information, treatment details, diagnosis codes, meal specifics, health insurance information, and patient IDs. Surprisingly, affected individuals were only notified by PurFoods on August 25, a considerable delay of seven months after the breach and over a month after the investigation concluded.
<br/>
PurFoods is offering 12 months of credit monitoring services through Kroll to those affected. However, Kroll itself recently fell victim to a cyberattack involving the theft of data from crypto companies like BlockFi, FTX, and Genesis. In that incident, a SIM swapping attack compromised an employee's phone number, providing unauthorized access to Kroll's network. The breach notice published on PurFoods' website includes a "noindex" code, preventing it from appearing in search results and potentially hindering affected individuals from discovering the breach notice.
