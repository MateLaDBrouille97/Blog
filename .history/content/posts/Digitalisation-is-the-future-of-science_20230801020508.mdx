Over the last two decades, advances in understanding living systems have been remarkable. The cost of sequencing a human genome has dramatically reduced from $100 million to less than a thousand, leading to a massive increase in data generation. Key chemical innovations, such as sequencing techniques, fluorescent tags, and biorthogonal reactions, have played pivotal roles in these developments. Collaboration between different disciplines is likely to fuel further progress. However, chemistry can benefit from adopting some ideas from biology, particularly in the race to digitalize empirical learning.
<br/>
Biologists are ahead of chemists in digitalizing experiments. Automation of large and complex biological experiments is routine in commercial biology labs, allowing for more efficient exploration of complex systems and emergent properties. Living systems are inherently noisy, but digital tools and automation reduce errors and boost the signal-to-noise ratio. Digitalized experiments also capture instructions systematically, enabling easy structuring of data for data-driven models and promoting reproducibility.
<br/>
Chemistry faces challenges in fully digitalizing experiments due to the diverse nature of chemical reactions, but it can learn from biology's successes and avoid pitfalls. While digital innovations bring vast improvements in data quality and volume for empirical learning in biology, it is crucial to ensure that the increased experimental throughput results in better science and efficiency. Statistical design and analysis of experiments (DOE) will continue to be vital in chemistry research and development until automation becomes more prevalent.
<br/>
As digital innovations reshape the landscape of biological and chemical research, maximizing the potential of experiments and using statistical tools like DOE will be essential for progress in understanding living systems and developing new scientific insights.

# ***Data Science and Digitalisation for Chemical Engineers***
<br/>
The article discusses how the increasing availability and use of data, driven by digitalization and Industry 4.0, are impacting the role of chemical engineers in process-based industries. With the rise of technologies like the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), there is a significant increase in data volume, velocity, and variety. This abundance of data provides opportunities for chemical engineers to make more informed decisions and improve processes.
<br/>
The proliferation of low-cost sensors, advancements in digital technology, and innovations in data science, including machine learning, allow chemical engineers to analyze previously overlooked data and gain valuable insights. Concepts like IIoT, cloud and edge computing, and data lakes play a crucial role in transforming old ways of doing business and creating value through data-driven decisions.
<br/>
As digitalization continues to advance, chemical engineers need to equip themselves with both fundamental knowledge and digital skills. The article presents the "data science journey" framework, which outlines different stages requiring varying levels of digital skills. Chemical engineers can benefit from developing data literacy, including collecting, managing, evaluating, and applying data, as well as data acumen, which involves good data judgment and modeling skills for predictive analytics.
<br/>
Universities are offering data science/analytics courses in chemical engineering to teach these concepts, and online platforms like Kaggle, Coursera, edX, and LinkedIn Learning provide opportunities for further learning. In advanced stages like prescriptive and cognitive analytics, professional data scientists with a combination of process knowledge and advanced programming skills play a vital role, offering internal training to upskill the workforce in data literacy and acumen.
<br/>
Digitalization is transforming the field of chemical engineering, necessitating a fusion of traditional knowledge and digital expertise to thrive in this data-driven era.
