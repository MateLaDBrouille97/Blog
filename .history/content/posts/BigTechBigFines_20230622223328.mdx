# Big Tech, Big Fines

<br />
Meta (formerly Facebook) has been fined 1.2 billion euros ($1.3 billion) by Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner for violating the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This fine contributes to Meta now holding seven out of the top ten highest fines for GDPR breaches. Previously, Amazon held the record for the largest GDPR fine, but Meta has now surpassed it. The GDPR aims to give users more control over their data and allows for fines to be imposed on companies that breach its articles. Since its implementation in 2018, there have been over 1,600 recorded breaches, but the actual number may be higher as not all fines are made public.

Public-facing AI tools like ChatGPT and text-to-image models are raising concerns about regulatory, legal, and online privacy issues. Malicious actors are exploiting generative AI capabilities to commit criminal offenses and spread misinformation, challenging governments' ability to keep up. A survey conducted by KPMG Australia and the University of Queensland revealed that only one third of respondents had confidence in governments, tech companies, and regulatory agencies to oversee AI regulation. Instead, research institutions, universities, and defense forces were seen as more capable. The European Commission has proposed the AI Act to regulate AI applications, while the United States lacks federal laws or binding policies on AI regulation.
