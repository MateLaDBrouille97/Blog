In the realm of technology, the inaugural Tech for Future event, organized by La Tribune, brought forth a myriad of trends that carry geopolitical implications and mark the dawn of a new era in innovation. The digital industry faces challenges such as funding hurdles, the swift progress of artificial intelligence, and geopolitical tensions. Engaging in deep discussion, experts delved into the financial, geopolitical, technological, philosophical, and political ramifications of the present crisis. A shift towards increased regulation and governance in the tech sector is underway, with policymakers assuming a vital role. The fierce competition between the United States and China, particularly in the realm of AI, stands as a key facet of their geopolitical rivalry. Europe, despite an initial lag, possesses valuable assets such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), allowing it to forge a technology model that serves societal and environmental interests. As the European tech scene embraces a new era of digital transformation and innovation, the future holds immense promise.
