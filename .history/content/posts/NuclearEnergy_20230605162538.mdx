# Uranium Mining Industry
<br/>
Uranium, discovered in 1789, has become crucial for nuclear power. The largest uranium miners are based in countries with significant reserves like Australia, Kazakhstan, and Canada. Kazatomprom, a Kazakhstani state-owned company, was the top producer in 2021, followed by France's Orano. Four out of the top ten uranium mines are located in Kazakhstan, contributing to 45% of the global supply. Namibia and Canada are also significant suppliers. Nuclear energy production peaked in 2001 but has since declined due to accidents and safety concerns. However, with the push for cleaner energy, nuclear power, and uranium mining may see a resurgence.

# The Environmental Impacts of Nuclear Waste
<br/>
Nuclear power is a crucial part of the UK's transition to sustainable energy, but it faces the challenge of radioactive waste, which poses a hazard to the environment and human health. The waste includes materials like graphite, reactor fuel, and uranium mill tailings, which remain radioactive for thousands of years. Various methods have been used to manage and store the waste, such as compaction and incineration, but these approaches have limitations. However, recent research from the University of Manchester offers promise. They have developed a technique using electrolysis to convert nuclear graphite waste into a molten salt substance, making it easier to handle and dispose of. This innovation could significantly speed up the disposal process and reduce costs. The combination of nuclear power with renewables is seen as a winning strategy for a green transition, and advancements in waste management methods bring hope for a more sustainable future.

# Storage and Disposal of Radioactive Waste
<br/>
Radioactive waste disposal involves storing and managing different types of waste to prevent radiation exposure and pollution. Low-level waste (LLW) is typically disposed of in near-surface facilities or caverns, while high-level waste (HLW) undergoes a storage period to allow for decay before further handling. HLW can be stored in ponds or dry casks. Deep geological disposal is the favored long-term solution for final disposal of the most radioactive waste. This method involves placing waste in stable geological formations, with a combination of engineered and natural barriers to prevent the release of radionuclides. Many countries have investigated deep geological disposal, and some have advanced in implementing it, such as Finland.
