In recent news, it has been reported that the US government is closely monitoring exports to China in order to prevent sales that could contribute to Beijing's militarization efforts. 
<br/>
Approximately 26% of export and re-export license applications were denied or returned without action in 2022, with a focus on identifying sensitive US technologies that could give China an advantage. 
<br/>
US has implemented export controls on nearly 700 Chinese entities, with over 200 additions since the start of the Biden administration. The goal is to counter China's military modernization and human rights abuses. 
<br/>
The Treasury Department is also considering restrictions on outbound investments in sensitive technologies to prevent them from enhancing military or intelligence capabilities in countries that pose a national security risk. 
<br/>
Meanwhile, President Biden has signed a debt bill that will allow the Treasury Department to resume net new debt issuance, putting an end to the disruption caused by the debt ceiling issue. The agreement reached between Biden and House Speaker McCarthy provides some relief in the fiscal situation. 
<br/>
In other news, Chinese Defense Minister Li Shangfu emphasized the importance of dialogue between China and the US and described a potential conflict as an "unbearable disaster." He highlighted the differences between the two countries but expressed the belief that they could coexist and grow together.
