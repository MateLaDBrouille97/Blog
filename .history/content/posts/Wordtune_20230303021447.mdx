Wordtune is a Google Chrome extension launched in 2018 that detects grammatical errors and rewrites sentences.
Wordtuneâ€™s grammar checker, tone checker, sentence rewriting, and translation features are available for free and for premium users, while its shortening and expanding sentences options and its smart synonyms feature are available only for premium users.
<br />
<br />
# Main features
<br />
## Grammar checker
The grammar checker for Wordtune works well enough and will flag basic spelling mistakes and grammar errors. It's not as slick as Grammarly for spotting mistakes, and it doesn't seem to flag passive writing, but overall, it will do a good enough job for most people.
<br />
## Tone Checker
The tone checker is only available for premium plans and allows you to write formally or casually.
<br />
## Rewrite Sentences
The rewrite sentence option is the main feature and the tool's primary purpose. The AI software will offer you alternatives for a new sentence when you highlight a sentence and click the Wordtune icon. 
<br />
## Shorten Sentences
Another premium feature is the shorter sentence option. This feature will offer you shorter alternatives to a sentence. So, again, highlight the sentence, hit the shorten option, and you get a list of options to make your sentence shorter. 
<br />
## Expand Sentences
This feature works in the same way as the shortened option, but this time, it makes your sentences longer.
<br />
## Smart synonym
When you highlight a single word on Wordtune, the software will give you many synonyms and alternative suggestions for the word.
<br />
## Translate Feature
Although you can only get results in English, you can add text in various other languages to the editor, and the tool will translate it to English.
