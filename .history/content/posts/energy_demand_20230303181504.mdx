[Nat Bullard](https://twitter.com/NatBullard), an analyst and columnist writing on energy, climate, and technology, recently published his annual presentation on decarbonization, with a look into the past, present, and future of our intertwined energy, transport, industry, technology, and financial systems.

Global primary energy demand growth is basically monotonic, but not equally distributed. Primary energy consumption peaked in 2007 for the countries of the OECD, while ex-OECD primary energy consumption surpassed the OECD. In 2021, the OECD accounted for less than 40% of global energy demand, down from over 70% six decades ago.
Wind and solar power capacity have been growing at record rates, and in 2022, they added between 600 and 700 terawatt-hours of new generation, which is more than any year of incremental growth in coal-fired power in the past three decades, except for 2021. This is also more than natural gas has ever added in a year and twice as much as nuclear added at its peak in the mid-1980s.

Global passenger car sales peaked in 2017 at about 85 million and have since fallen to below 70 million, while electric vehicle (EV) sales have increased an order of magnitude, from less than one million to more than 10 million. EVs are now the only growth area in the automotive industry.
China is the worldâ€™s biggest auto market and has surpassed the US. Internal combustion engine car sales in China peaked in 2017, and EVs are now the only growth in the sector. China produced just under 800,000 EVs in 2017, but it produced 6.7 million last year, putting it close to Germany as an auto exporter.

Decarbonization progress can be described as three overlapping S-curves: renewable energy, energy transition, and net zero. Net zero is an evolution of intention and a revolution in terms of capability and scale required to make it work. Decarbonizing industries such as aluminum, cement, and steel is a planet-scale challenge that requires significant effort.
Human capital is another net zero challenge. While students, young professionals, and entrepreneurs are dedicating their lives to deep decarbonization, energy expertise is essentially absent in the global boardroom. Only 1.2% of Fortune 100 board members have any qualification in energy, and just 0.2% have any expertise in climate.
