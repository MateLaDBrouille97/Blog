According to the European Accommodation Barometer Summer 2023, a survey commissioned by Booking.com and conducted by Statista, only 8% of accommodation businesses in Europe currently use AI-powered business applications. However, an additional 23% plan on introducing AI tools within the next six months. This indicates a potential quadrupling of AI users in the accommodation sector in a short period of time. To learn more about the findings, a report can be downloaded, and there is an online presentation of the summer edition of the Accommodation Barometer available for registration. Booking.com sponsored the post, and Statista offers daily infographics on various topics.

According to the European Accommodation Barometer Summer 2023, social media marketing is a top priority for European hoteliers in digitalizing their businesses. Over one-third of respondents emphasized its importance, followed by website creation and maintenance. Managing customer relationships and online advertising are also key areas of focus for hoteliers. The survey was conducted by Statista on behalf of Booking.com. Additionally, Statista offers daily infographics on various topics and sectors, including economy, politics, technology, health, and sports.
