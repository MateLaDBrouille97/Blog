# What is Wolfram Alpha?
<br/>
Wolfram Alpha stands apart from conventional search engines by leveraging intricate algorithms and advanced knowledge to yield results. The search engine is bifurcated into four categories: Mathematics, Science and Technology, Society and Culture, and Everyday Life, each housing an array of subtopics to explore. Wolfram Alpha is a valuable asset for students of mathematics or those employed in the field, but it also caters to everyday users with more basic queries, such as "What is the time in London?" or "What size turkey should I get for fifteen guests?".

It is crucial to note that Wolfram Alpha is not a private search engine and collects substantial data on its users, which may be shared with third parties and used for unsolicited mail. While it is possible to block cookies, it could negatively impact the search results. To obtain the desired results, users must be aware of how to search within Wolfram Alpha. There are samples available to aid users in deciphering what to search for and how to search.
<br/>
Wolfram Alpha is accessible through mobile apps designed for Android, iPad, iPhone, Kindle Fire, Windows phones, and tablets. Wolfram Alpha Pro is a paid subscription with advanced features like file upload for data analysis and web apps, but it remains unclear what benefits are conferred by the price.
<br/>
Despite competing with virtual assistants' AI capabilities, Wolfram Alpha distinguishes itself by providing specific, relevant answers and additional information that users may find useful. In summary, Wolfram Alpha is a highly effective search engine with a wide range of applications, suitable for both academic and everyday users alike.
