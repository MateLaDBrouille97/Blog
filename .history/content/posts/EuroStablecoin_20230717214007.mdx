The recently approved Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation is set to bring much-needed regulatory clarity and establish a standard for global crypto regulations. One of the most promising outcomes of this new framework is that it will enable the creation of a European stablecoin, addressing the lack of a widely adopted euro-backed stablecoin in the market.
<br/>
Previously, negative interest rates in the eurozone and regulatory burdens posed obstacles to the development of a euro stablecoin. However, the European Central Bank (ECB) has ended its 11-year monetary policy experiment in 2022, and MiCA provides a clear and stable regulatory environment, making it more attractive for organizations to issue a euro-backed stablecoin.
<br/>
A euro-based stablecoin is essential for the future health of European crypto markets, as the euro is a significant currency in the global economy. It would allow European startups to reduce their reliance on the stability of the US economy, offering the same benefits as dollar-pegged stablecoins without the foreign exchange exposure.
<br/>
Furthermore, a euro-backed stablecoin provides regulatory diversification and lessens counterparty risk, benefiting the market as a whole. After its launch, the balance between euro and dollar stablecoins in circulation is expected to reflect the proportion of euros and dollars in the regular fiat economy, with euro stablecoins gaining traction if the US continues to lack regulatory clarity and hinders the growth of digital assets markets. This situation could give the European Union a significant edge in the crypto market.

### ***Euro stablecoin market set to take off, thanks to real-world uses, regulatory clarity â€” Circle exec***

Patrick Hansen, the European Union strategy and policy director at Circle, presented an optimistic outlook for the euro-denominated stablecoin market during his speech at EthCC in Paris. While the US dollar currently maintains its first-mover advantage in the stablecoin space, Hansen believes that euro stablecoins will witness a surge in real-world use cases, ultimately increasing their market share.
<br/>
Currently, euro-denominated stablecoins represent only 0.3% of the stablecoin market, amounting to a value of $300 million. In contrast, the euro holds a significant 20% share in the traditional monetary system, second only to the US dollar. However, Hansen believes that as the crypto capital markets shift from speculation to utility, the use of stablecoins in remittances, business-to-business transactions, and other practical cases will drive demand for euro stablecoins. Additionally, integrating euro stablecoins into existing European payment systems will further bolster their adoption.
<br/>
Hansen also pointed out that decentralized finance (DeFi) will follow a similar trajectory, with real-world applications, such as car loans, being provided in local currencies. This will lead to the emergence of more regionalized liquidity pools.
<br/>
Regulatory clarity in the European Union is expected to be achieved through the passage of the Markets in Crypto-Assets regulations, and this may even be accompanied by regulatory incentives. Circle's Euro Coin (EUROC), among the top five euro-denominated stablecoins in the market, is seeking a license in France to become a fully compliant e-money token.
<br/>
Hansen believes that euro-denominated stablecoins have a promising future ahead, driven by increased practical use cases and integration into existing financial systems.

### ***Burgeoning Market Demand Driving Euro-stablecoin Expansion***
<br/>

<br />
The European private sector has fallen behind the US in the development of cryptocurrency and digital assets, particularly euro-based stablecoins, which represent less than 1% of the total market capitalization of USD-based stablecoins. The eurozone's large trading area and Europe's significant cryptocurrency economy make this disparity surprising. However, as European financial institutions and institutional investors enter the market and demand for DeFi tokens increases, the need for euro-based stablecoins is expected to grow. Using USD stablecoins exposes users to FX risk and subjects them to US regulatory influence, which could undermine the effectiveness of European Central Bank policy. EURST, a euro-based stablecoin by Wallex, aims to bridge traditional finance and blockchain while providing stability and full transparency.
