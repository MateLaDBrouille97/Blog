<br/>
The European Union is taking steps to protect its strategic technologies from potential misuse by foreign countries, particularly China. The EU has proposed an economic security strategy that focuses on four critical technological areas: semiconductors, artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, and biotechnology. These technologies are seen as essential for economic development and national security.
<br/>
The strategy aims to control the transfer of dual-use technologies that have both commercial and military applications. It also addresses the resilience of supply chains, the risks of economic coercion, and the security of cyber and physical infrastructures. The European Commission has proposed a method for categorizing sensitive technologies, but the final list will be established through consensus with EU member states.
<br/>
While the strategy does not specifically mention China, it is clear that the country's rise as a technological powerhouse has influenced the EU's approach. China's state capitalism and industrial policies have created asymmetries in the European market, leading to calls for protective measures. However, officials argue that these measures are not protectionist but rather a response to market distortions and an attempt to rebalance the playing field.
<br/>
The EU's strategy marks a shift in mentality within the European Commission, which is now focused on defensive measures and addressing the deficiencies of free trade. However, it does not signal a complete departure from the EU's commitment to free trade and multilateralism. The goal is to protect strategic industries and avoid further deindustrialization while still maintaining economic interdependence with the rest of the world.
<br/>
It is important to note that the EU still supports free trade agreements with major partners and is considering measures to secure critical materials through trade. The EU's approach to protecting its technologies reflects the changing global landscape and the need to safeguard economic interests and national security.

# ***U.S. Cannot Halt China's Semiconductor Advance to 5nm: Ex TSMC VP***
<br/>
China's semiconductor company SMIC and telecom giant Huawei have managed to advance their chip technology despite restrictions imposed by the US, according to Burn J. Lin, former vice president of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). Lin believes that SMIC's ownership of ASML lithography tools will enable the company to progress to a 5nm-class fabrication process. Despite US sanctions, SMIC has developed its second-generation 7nm-class fabrication process, achieving high enough yields for Huawei to plan the supply of 70 million smartphones. It is alleged that SMIC used ASML's Twinscan NXT:2000i litho tool, which was curbed by the Dutch government earlier this year in its exports to China. Although the tool's resolution is sufficient for 7nm-class fabrication, a finer resolution is required for the 5nm-class process. SMIC has reportedly achieved acceptable yields by using multi-patterning, a technique that involves splitting complex patterns into simpler ones. The US sanctions against China's semiconductor sector may have inadvertently created opportunities for SMIC, as restrictions on TSMC have allowed it to secure substantial orders. Lin suggests that the US should focus on maintaining its chip design leadership, as China's whole-nation strategy to boost its chip industry is difficult to limit and could harm the global economy.

# ***Commission welcomes G7 leaders' agreement on Guiding Principles and a Code of Conduct on Artificial Intelligence***
<br/>
The European Commission has welcomed the agreement by G7 leaders on International Guiding Principles on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and a voluntary Code of Conduct for AI developers under the Hiroshima AI process. These principles and code will complement the legally binding rules that the EU co-legislators are finalizing under the EU AI Act. The principles provide guidance for organizations developing, deploying, and using advanced AI systems to promote the safety and trustworthiness of the technology. They include commitments to mitigate risks and misuse, encourage responsible information sharing, and invest in cybersecurity. The code of conduct will provide detailed and practical guidance for AI developers and promote responsible governance of AI globally. Both documents will be reviewed and updated as necessary. The G7 leaders have called on organizations developing advanced AI systems to commit to the application of the Code of Conduct.
<br/>
The G7 Hiroshima AI Process was established to promote guardrails for advanced AI systems on a global level. The EU actively worked with key international partners in the G7 to develop the principles and the Code of Conduct, which are consistent with the legally binding rules of the EU AI Act. The AI Act aims to guarantee the safety and fundamental rights of people and businesses while strengthening AI uptake, investment, and innovation in the EU. It will provide risk-based rules for AI systems placed on the market or put into service in the EU. The Commission calls on AI developers to sign and implement the Code of Conduct as soon as possible.
