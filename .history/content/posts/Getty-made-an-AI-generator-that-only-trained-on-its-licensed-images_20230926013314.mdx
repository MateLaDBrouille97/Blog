Getty Images has joined forces with Nvidia to introduce "Generative AI by Getty Images," a groundbreaking tool that allows users to create images using Getty's extensive library of licensed photos. This innovative tool is exclusively trained on Getty Images' vast collection, including premium content, providing full copyright protection to users. Any images generated with this tool and used for commercial purposes will be legally safeguarded. Getty collaborated with Nvidia, utilizing its Edify model from Nvidia's generative AI model library Picasso.
<br/>
The tool impressed with its ability to produce realistic human figures, providing high-quality results that could easily pass for genuine Getty-watermarked photos. However, the tool's illustration mode was limited to producing 2D, clip-art style renderings.
<br/>
Importantly, images created with this tool will not be added to the Getty Images and iStock content libraries. Creators will be compensated if Getty uses their AI-generated image for model training or other purposes, with revenue sharing based on both file usage and traditional licensing revenue.
<br/>
Getty's tool comes with certain limitations, including restrictions on generating images of real-world people or manipulating real-life events. Users can access Generative AI by Getty Images through the Getty Images website, with pricing determined by prompt volume. Users gain perpetual, worldwide, and unlimited rights to the images they create.
<br/>
This move by Getty allows the company to leverage its extensive image library while protecting its assets from unauthorized use. It also addresses concerns regarding copyright infringement in the AI-generated content space, ensuring artists and photographers receive recognition and compensation for their work. Furthermore, Getty plans to enhance the tool, allowing users to incorporate their own data and brand style, making it a versatile creative resource.

# ***You can now prompt ChatGPT with pictures and voice commands***
<br/>
OpenAI is introducing significant changes to ChatGPT, not just in terms of its capabilities, but also in how users can interact with the AI. Users will now have the option to prompt ChatGPT by speaking aloud or by uploading images in addition to typing text. These new features are being rolled out first to paying ChatGPT users, with wider availability expected shortly.
<br/>
The voice interaction feature functions similarly to virtual assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant. Users can ask questions verbally, and ChatGPT will convert their speech into text, process it, generate a response, and then vocalize the answer. OpenAI is leveraging its Whisper model for speech-to-text processing and introducing a new text-to-speech model to provide human-like audio responses.
<br/>
OpenAI is also partnering with Spotify to utilize synthetic voices for podcast translation into different languages while maintaining the original podcaster's voice. While this technology offers exciting possibilities, OpenAI acknowledges potential risks, such as impersonation and fraud, and plans to control its use tightly.
<br/>
The image search capability allows users to take a picture of an object or scene, and ChatGPT will attempt to understand the query and respond accordingly. Users can further clarify their requests with text or voice. However, OpenAI has limited ChatGPT's ability to analyze or make direct statements about individuals, prioritizing privacy and accuracy.
<br/>
OpenAI faces the challenge of expanding ChatGPT's features without introducing new problems and risks. While the company has set certain limitations, such as restricted analysis of people and controlled usage, as voice and image interactions become more prevalent, it may become increasingly difficult to maintain these safeguards. Nevertheless, OpenAI's ongoing efforts aim to strike a balance between innovation and responsible AI usage.

# ***Meta’s AI chatbot plan includes a ‘sassy robot’ for younger users***
<br/>
Meta is gearing up to unveil a generative AI chatbot called "Gen AI Personas," aimed at younger users. This announcement is expected during the company's Meta Connect event. These chatbots will come in various "personas" designed to engage young users with vibrant and diverse behaviors. This move is influenced by the rapid rise of ChatGPT as one of the fastest-growing apps in the past year.
<br/>
Prior to this, Meta had reportedly tested chatbot personas with a more general target audience on Instagram. These included a "sassy robot" persona inspired by Bender from Futurama and an inquisitive "Alvin the Alien." Some concerns arose regarding privacy implications, particularly with the latter persona.
<br/>
Meta plans to develop dozens of such chatbots and is even working on a chatbot creation tool, allowing celebrities to create their own chatbots for fan engagement. Some chatbots may also focus on productivity, assisting with tasks like coding.
<br/>
Additionally, Meta is working on a more powerful large language model to compete with OpenAI's GPT-4. This model will underpin various Meta products, including ChatGPT and Bing. They are also developing AI models to enhance Horizon Worlds avatars.
<br/>
The overarching goal of these chatbots, according to former Snap and Instagram executive Meghana Dhar, is to engage Gen Z users for longer periods, providing Meta with increased opportunities to serve ads. These chatbots are seen as part of Meta's broader strategy to keep users within its ecosystem.
<br/>
Meta Connect will also showcase more about the company's metaverse project and the new Quest 3 headset, further emphasizing Meta's commitment to pushing the boundaries of technology and user engagement.

# ***AI Race: Amazon to Invest $4 Billion into OpenAI Rival Anthropic***
<br/>
Amazon has announced a significant investment of up to $4 billion in Anthropic, an AI startup founded by the Amodei siblings, Dario and Daniela. The Amodei siblings are known for their creation, Claude chatbot, and their previous work at OpenAI. This move is aimed at bolstering Amazon's position in the competitive AI landscape, where rivals like Microsoft have also made substantial investments, such as the $13 billion investment in OpenAI.
<br/>
Anthropic's AI platforms, Claude and Claude 2, are formidable language model-based chatbots akin to OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard. These chatbots excel in tasks like translation, coding, and answering queries, with a key differentiator being their commitment to safety and reliability. Claude can autonomously revise responses, reducing the need for human moderation and excelling in handling extensive prompts, making it valuable for tasks involving lengthy documents.
<br/>
The partnership between Amazon and Anthropic involves Amazon securing a minority stake in Anthropic and integrating the startup's technology into various aspects of its business operations, including Amazon Bedrock, its AI application-building service. Additionally, Anthropic will leverage Amazon's custom chips to develop, train, and deploy AI foundation models, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) will become its primary cloud provider.
<br/>
Amazon's initial investment is $1.25 billion, with the potential to increase to $4 billion, making it one of the most substantial investments associated with AWS. Despite this partnership, Anthropic will continue its collaboration with Google, which also holds a stake in the startup.
<br/>
This move by Amazon reflects its commitment to AI innovation and signals a transformative chapter in the tech industry. With tech giants like Amazon and Google vying for dominance in AI, Anthropic is poised to be a key player in the rapidly evolving AI landscape.
