In a paper titled “Are Ideas Getting Harder to Find,” authors Bloom, Jones, Van Reenen, and Webb examine how the amount of R&D resources required to achieve technological advancement has been rising across various domains, from Moore’s Law to agriculture and health outcomes. They find that, while growth has been steady in these domains, the amount of human minds required to achieve that growth has multiplied over the past few decades. The authors also look at machine learning and creative patents to demonstrate a decline in research productivity in these areas. They observe that while some industries may see consistent growth over time, for most industries, growth in sales per R&D worker has dropped over the past two decades. Finally, authors consider national and industry-wide measurements of total factor productivity (TFP), which have shown a decline in productivity over the years.
Across varied domains, the R&D efforts necessary to eke out technological improvement keep getting higher.
Moore’s law shows that while the rate of progress has been steady at 35% per year, the effective number of researchers has grown nearly 20-fold since 1971.
In agriculture, the increase in annual yields across major crops has been remarkably consistent for half a century, on the whole, but the gains are costing more and more.
Machine learning progress can be measured on a wide variety of accepted benchmarks, and increased research efforts have not yielded any visible increase in the growth rate of progress.
In patents, it seems more R&D effort has been roughly matched by more patenting, and in fact, in recent years, patenting has increased faster than R&D effort.
The decline in creative patents is not everywhere universal, but the norm is that innovation becomes harder.
Total Factor Productivity can be computed for entire industries or economies, making it a favorite measure of progress.
