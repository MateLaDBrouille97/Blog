In a recent cyberattack, hackers targeted Intellihartx, a Tennessee-based company that manages patient payment balances and collections, through their vendor, Fortra. The attack resulted in the theft of personal and health information belonging to approximately 489,830 patients. The stolen data includes patient names, addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, medical billing and insurance information, diagnoses, and medication details.
<br/>
The cyberattack on Intellihartx is part of a larger ransomware campaign that exploited a security flaw in Fortra's GoAnywhere file-transfer software. The attack affected numerous organizations, including Hatch Bank, Rubrik, and the City of Toronto. The Clop ransomware group claimed responsibility for the mass exploitation.
<br/>
This incident has had a significant impact on the healthcare industry, with millions of patients across the United States having their health information compromised. The severity of the attack led the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to issue a warning alert about Clop's targeting of the healthcare sector.
<br/>
Clop has a history of targeting vendors of file transfer tools, having previously attacked Accellion's file transfer appliance and, more recently, engaging in a mass-hack involving Progress Systems' MOVEit file transfer tool.
<br/>
The breach of personal and health information poses serious risks to the affected patients, including the potential for identity theft and fraudulent activities. It also highlights the growing threat of ransomware attacks targeting the healthcare industry, underscoring the need for robust cybersecurity measures and heightened vigilance to protect sensitive data.
