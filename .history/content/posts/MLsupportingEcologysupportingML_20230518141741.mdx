In our data-driven era, the abundance of digital information permeates every facet of society. Unsurprisingly, this extends to the realm of animal ecology, where the utilization of digital sensing has surged in recent years. These technological advancements have opened up new avenues for observing and comprehending the animal kingdom. Join me on an enlightening journey as I share captivating success stories that illustrate the intersection of machine learning and conservation. Discover how camera traps and drone data have revolutionized censusing, population estimation, and our overall understanding of animal behavior. Furthermore, I will outline key collaborative measures required to strengthen this interface, fostering a united front against the pressing biodiversity crisis.
