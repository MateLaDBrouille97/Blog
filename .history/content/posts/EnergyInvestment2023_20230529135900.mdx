The World Energy Investment 2023 report highlights the current state of clean energy investment and the challenges faced by policy makers and investors. The report notes that while there is positive momentum behind clean energy investment, it is not distributed evenly across countries or sectors. The macroeconomic environment presents additional obstacles, with higher short-term returns for fossil fuel assets and rising borrowing costs and debt burdens. The report also highlights the challenges faced by investors in financing clean energy projects, which often require high upfront spending
<br/>
The report notes that more than 90% of the increase in clean energy investment since 2021 has taken place in advanced economies and China. While there are bright spots elsewhere, such as solar investment in India and deployment in Brazil, higher interest rates, unclear policy frameworks, financially-strained utilities, and a high cost of capital are holding back investment in many other countries. The report also highlights the challenges faced by investors in financing clean energy projects, which often require high upfront spending
<br/>
The report notes that after an unbroken run of cost declines, prices for some key clean energy technologies rose in 2021 and 2022 due to higher input prices for critical minerals, semiconductors, and bulk materials like steel and cement. While these price pressures have eased since, wind turbine costs, especially for European manufacturers, remained high in early 2023, at 35% above the low levels of early 2020. Permitting has been a key concern for investors and financiers, especially for wind and grid infrastructure
<br/>
While solar deployment has been increasing year-on-year, the project pipeline for some other technologies has been less reliable. Investment in wind power has varied year-on-year in key markets in response to changing policy circumstances. Nuclear investment is rising, but hydropower, a key low-emission source of power market flexibility, has been on a downward trend. Weak grid infrastructure is a limiting factor for renewable investment in many developing economies, and here too current investment flows are highly concentrated. Advanced economies and China account for 80% of global spending and for almost all of the growth in recent years
<br/>
The report also presents a mixed picture on the prospects for energy efficiency and end-use investments. They rose in 2022 thanks to the stimulus provided by new policies in Europe and North America, alongside exceptionally high energy prices. However, the report expects spending to flatten in 2023 amid a slowdown in construction activity, higher borrowing costs, and strains on household budgets
<br/>
The World Energy Investment 2023 report highlights the challenges faced by policy makers and investors in ensuring a broad-based and secure transition to clean energy. While there is positive momentum behind clean energy investment, it is not distributed evenly across countries or sectors. The report notes that higher short-term returns for fossil fuel assets and rising borrowing costs and debt burdens present additional obstacles. The report also highlights the challenges faced by investors in financing clean energy projects, which often require high upfront spending.
