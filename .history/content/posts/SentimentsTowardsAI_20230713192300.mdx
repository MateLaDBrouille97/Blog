A recent survey conducted by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) reveals shifting sentiments towards artificial intelligence (AI) in the workplace. The survey, which included C-suite leaders, managers, and frontline employees from 18 countries, shows a significant increase in optimism and a decrease in concern about AI compared to five years ago.

While general curiosity about AI remains consistent at 60%, over 50% of workers surveyed now express optimism about AI's impact on work, a 17-percentage point increase since 2018. Concern about AI has decreased by 10 percentage points, with 30% of respondents still expressing worry. Confidence in AI's influence on work has grown by 9 percentage points, and indifference has reduced by 7 percentage points.

However, sentiments vary among different positions within companies. Two-thirds of leaders are optimistic about AI, while less than half of frontline employees share the same sentiment. Frontline employees also show the highest level of concern (around 40%) about AI in the workplace. Managers fall in between leaders and frontline employees in terms of their optimism about AI.

The survey also highlights the correlation between AI usage and optimism. Regular AI users, defined as those who use AI at least once a week for work, are nearly three times more optimistic than concerned about AI's impact. Even rare users of AI are more optimistic than cautious, with non-users expressing the most concern.
<br/>
Notably, leaders are the most frequent AI users, with 80% of polled leaders stating they are regular users. Managers and frontline employees have lower adoption rates, potentially due to limited access or workplace policies.
<br/>
While there is no consensus on whether AI will replace jobs, survey respondents agree that AI will have an impact on employment. More than one-third of respondents feel their jobs are in jeopardy, and 86% believe they need training to adapt to AI's transformative effects.

As AI continues to evolve rapidly, upskilling and training may be crucial for individuals to navigate the AI revolution effectively. The increasing optimism and awareness around AI suggest that it is not merely a passing trend but a significant force shaping the future of work.

Artificial intelligence (AI) elicits a mixed response globally, according to the World Risk Poll 2021. The poll, conducted in 121 countries with 125,000 respondents, found that the average ratio of people believing AI would "mostly help" their country over the next 20 years was 1.4. However, there were significant regional variations. East Asia had the highest ratio at 4.4, while Eastern Africa had the lowest at 0.4. The United States expressed skepticism with a ratio of 0.9, potentially due to concerns about job losses. In contrast, China had a ratio of 4.5, indicating a strong belief in the positive impact of AI. Factors such as access to the internet, religious views, and experiences of discrimination also influenced perceptions of AI. The study emphasizes the need for policymakers and industry leaders to understand public sentiment to address concerns and shape the development of AI technologies.
