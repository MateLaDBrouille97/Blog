OpenAI's ChatGPT, a revolutionary language model, has made a significant impact since its launch. The app quickly became the most-downloaded productivity app in Apple's store after expanding its availability to several European countries. OpenAI's aggressive approach to deploying its technology in various sectors, including business, education, and personal lives, has been highly successful. According to a survey by Deutsche Bank, 44% of US workers in April reported using ChatGPT in their workplaces, with 22% using it heavily. In the UK, 14% of respondents also indicated heavy usage.
<br/>
Microsoft's $10 billion investment in OpenAI has allowed the company to keep costs low, enabling widespread adoption and experimentation. This move has prompted other tech giants, such as Alphabet, to accelerate their own AI technologies' deployment to avoid falling behind in the AI race. The potential economic impact of ChatGPT is significant, with McKinsey estimating a $15.7 trillion global boost.
<br/>
However, OpenAI founder Sam Altman's recent comments about compliance with the European Commission's proposed AI Act have raised concerns. Altman stated that if OpenAI couldn't comply, the company would "cease operating" in the market. While he later clarified that OpenAI has no immediate plans to leave Europe, the threat was clear. European Commissioner Thierry Breton criticized Altman's comments as "blackmail," emphasizing the importance of regulations for citizen security and well-being.
<br/>
Tech companies often employ a playbook of becoming popular and then threatening to leave to resist regulation. Uber, Airbnb, Meta Platforms, and TikTok have employed similar tactics in the past. While tech leaders express concern about AI risks and support regulation in general, they often resist specific provisions that could impact their operations. As AI becomes more ingrained in society, the power of AI leaders to shape regulation and demand concessions will grow.
<br/>
While Altman has been accessible to concerned parties, skepticism remains about whether this time will be any different in terms of tech companies' willingness to cooperate with regulation. The increasing dependence on AI and the growing influence of AI leaders call for careful consideration and effective governance to ensure the technology's responsible and beneficial deployment.
