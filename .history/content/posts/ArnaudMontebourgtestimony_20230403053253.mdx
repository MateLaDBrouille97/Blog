Energy production is not a matter of left or right. Citizens are responsible for answering the question. 
I do not share all of Mr Montebourg's political views, but I do share his notion of energy sovereignty.
<br />
This video discusses the  hearings of the commission of inquiry created at the request of the political group Les RÃ©publicains in France. The commission is investigating the reasons behind the loss of energy sovereignty in the country. The latest witness to testify before the commission is Arnaud Montebourg, former Minister of Industrial Renewal (2012-2014) and a member of the Socialist Party.
