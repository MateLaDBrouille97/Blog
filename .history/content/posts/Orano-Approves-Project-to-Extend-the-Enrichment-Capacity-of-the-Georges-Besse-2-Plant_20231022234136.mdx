On October 19, 2023, the Board of Directors of Orano convened to greenlight a substantial investment in the expansion of production capacity at the Georges Besse 2 uranium enrichment plant, nestled within the Tricastin site in Drôme et Vaucluse. This ambitious project, requiring an estimated investment of 1.7 billion euros, paves the way for Orano to amplify its production capabilities by over 30%, an equivalent of 2.5 million Separative Work Units (SWUs).
<br/>
The expansion initiative revolves around the construction of four new modules, mirroring the existing fourteen with proven technology and an emphasis on minimizing environmental impact. The construction phase will be a driving force for the employment of approximately 1,000 individuals, with a significant portion hailing from regional enterprises.
<br/>
Claude Imauven, the Chairman of Orano's Board of Directors, emphasized that this endeavor is a strategic response to the prevailing geopolitical climate, aiming to reinforce France's energy sovereignty. This decision aligns with the customers' demand for a more secure energy supply, with production set to commence in 2028.
<br/>
François Lurin, Senior Executive Vice President for Chemistry-Enrichment Activities, highlighted that the project's fruition is indebted to customer support and the tireless efforts of Orano's technical and commercial teams. The enriched uranium from the Tricastin site will support low-carbon energy equivalent to the needs of 120 million households each year. Lurin also acknowledged the pivotal role played by Japanese (JFEI) and Korean (KHNP) shareholders in the Tricastin enrichment company SETH in bringing this project to life.
<br/>
The Georges Besse 2 plant, initiated in 2011, attained its full production capacity of 7.5 million SWUs in 2016, making use of centrifugation technology, ensuring top-tier safety, cost-effectiveness, energy conservation, technical reliability, and minimal environmental impact.
<br/>
Orano, a global nuclear materials operator, is dedicated to addressing contemporary and future energy and health challenges. Through cutting-edge technology and unwavering commitment to safety, Orano's 17,000-strong workforce contributes to the transformation and control of nuclear materials, fostering a sustainable, resource-efficient world. In essence, Orano is dedicated to maximizing the potential of nuclear energy.

# ***Colocation provider plans to use modular nuclear reactors to power its data centers***
<br/>
Data center provider Standard Power is addressing power shortage challenges in data centers by deploying small modular nuclear reactors from NuScale Power Corporation in its facilities located in Ohio and Pennsylvania. These data centers specialize in high-performance computing for tasks like blockchain mining and AI workloads, which require substantial electricity. Concerned about the capacity of local electrical grids to support these demanding workloads, Standard Power is partnering with NuScale to provide a carbon-free, baseload energy solution.
<br/>
In total, 24 of NuScale's small modular reactors, capable of generating 77 megawatts each or 1.8 GW in total, will be deployed across the Ohio and Pennsylvania facilities. This substantial power generation capacity will meet the high demands of these data centers.
<br/>
Small modular reactors represent a new approach to nuclear power, being built on an assembly line and deployable in clusters as needed. NuScale is the first to receive approval from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission for commercial deployments. Microsoft is also exploring the use of small modular reactors to power its data centers.
<br/>
While concerns about nuclear power often revolve around past accidents, modern nuclear facilities like these employ advanced safety measures and water-based solutions, making them a viable option for supporting digital infrastructure. This move toward nuclear power addresses the increasing demand for energy as data centers grow in scale and power requirements, potentially providing a more sustainable and reliable energy source for the data center industry.

# ***Hydrogen Electrolysis Can Give Nuclear Power a Boost***
<br/>
Nuclear power, responsible for 18% of U.S. electricity in 2022, faces hurdles in terms of efficiency and profitability. The University of Toledo, Ohio, led by Associate Professor Raghav Khanna, collaborated with the U.S. Department of Energy's Idaho National Laboratory to explore nuclear-renewable integrated energy systems. These systems aim to make nuclear power more profitable by integrating it with hydrogen-electrolyzer and fuel-cell technology. When grid demand is low and electricity prices are unfavorable, nuclear power is diverted to hydrogen production. Subsequently, stored hydrogen can be converted back into electricity when demand surges, using a dynamic pricing mechanism known as transactive energy.
<br/>
To optimize this complex process, the researchers leveraged deep-reinforcement learning, a type of machine learning, to make real-time decisions based on dynamic factors like weather, renewable energy availability, location, and time of day. Their model predicted a 27% increase in revenue over 120 days by integrating hydrogen production with nuclear power. The research's implications extend to increasing revenue for energy providers and reducing costs for consumers.
<br/>
This innovative approach is part of a broader U.S. government initiative to promote green hydrogen and renewable energy sources. It offers a blueprint for enhancing the efficiency and profitability of nuclear power, potentially revitalizing existing nuclear plants that struggle to compete in the current energy market. The study's findings were presented at the 2023 IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting in Orlando, Florida, and they highlight the transformative potential of advanced machine learning in reshaping the energy landscape.

# ***Power for Africa: The boom of nuclear energy?***
<br/>
Burkina Faso, one of the world's least electrified nations, recently signed an agreement with Russia's Rosatom to build a nuclear power plant, aiming to boost its electricity capacity. The move, however, faces skepticism from experts who believe that solar energy, which the country also produces, should be the solution. This nuclear power project is part of President Ibrahim Traore's shift towards Russia as a partner, turning away from former colonial power, France.
<br/>
Burkina Faso is not the only African nation considering nuclear energy. Mali is exploring civilian nuclear power with Rosatom, and Egypt is constructing a nuclear power plant with Russian blocks generating 1,200 MW of power. Uganda has signed an agreement with China to build two reactor blocks, while Kenya plans to build a nuclear power plant by 2027. Kenya, known for its renewable energy utilization, faces skepticism over the nuclear project.
<br/>
Some experts believe that the push for nuclear power in Africa is motivated by financial gain, and they warn of potential risks associated with reactor accidents. Critics highlight that nuclear power is not popular in many industrialized countries.
<br/>
Rwanda is taking a unique approach by partnering with Dual Fluid Energy to build a test reactor with innovative liquid fuel and coolant technology that reduces radioactive waste.
<br/>
While some view the nuclear boom in Africa as an opportunity for industrialization and job creation, others question whether it truly benefits the continent. The nuclear energy debate in Africa continues, with varying opinions on the suitability and sustainability of nuclear power as an energy source.
