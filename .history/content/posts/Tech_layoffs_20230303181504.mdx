  2023 is looking much worse for technology companies than 2022 as tech giants
  such as Amazon, Microsoft, Google, IBM, SAP, Salesforce, and Facebook parent
  company Alphabet announce sweeping job cuts. Although global IT spending is
  forecast to rise in 2023, with enterprise software and IT services
  experiencing the greatest growth, the overall increase is expected to be
  modest. Continuing supply chain issues, inflation, and the war in Ukraine are
  also having an impact on both business and consumer spending, leading to fears
  of recession. According to data compiled by Layoffs.fyi, the online tracker
  keeping tabs on job losses in the technology sector, tech companies have laid
  off 101,657 workers in the first six weeks of the year, equivalent to 64% of
  total tech company layoffs for all of 2022. The silver lining for technology
  pros is that many of the layoffs involve non-technical staff. 
  Although global IT spending is expected to rise this year, the
  increase is expected to be modest, with data center systems and communications
  services predicted to grow by less than 1%. Smaller tech firms have also been
  affected, with a lack of experienced tech talent causing companies to raise
  salaries for IT professionals. The article

  industry's turmoil.
