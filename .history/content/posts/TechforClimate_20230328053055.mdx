Technology plays a crucial role in the transition towards a more sustainable and resilient world. Experts and companies engaged in this transition recognize both the potential and the limits of technology.
<br/>
Aurore Stephant, a mining engineer specialized in environmental and health risks of mineral supply chains, emphasizes the need to use technology to reduce the environmental and social impacts of mining. 
However, she also warns against the illusion of a technological fix and highlights the importance of a holistic approach that considers the entire supply chain and involves stakeholders.
<br/>
Hugues Ferreboeuf, a speaker on engineering and management of transitions, stresses the need to shift from a linear, resource-intensive economy to a circular, regenerative one. 
He advocates for the use of technology to enable this transition, but warns against the risk of rebound effects and the need to consider the entire system.
<br/>
Lionel Fournier, Director of Health and Ecology at Harmonie Mutuelle and Director of Sustainable Development at the Vyv Group, emphasizes the role of technology in improving health and well-being, for example through telemedicine or smart buildings. 
He also highlights the need to address the digital divide and ensure that technology benefits all.
<br/>
VÃ©ronique Torner, a member of the Executive Committee and administrator of Numeum in charge of the Responsible Digital program, emphasizes the need to ensure that technology is used responsibly, taking into account its environmental and social impacts. 
She advocates for the use of digital tools to enable a more sustainable and inclusive economy, but warns against the risks of data privacy and security breaches.
<br/>
In conclusion, technology can play a crucial role in the transition towards a more sustainable and resilient world, but its use must be accompanied by a holistic approach that considers the entire system and involves stakeholders. 
Moreover, the responsible use of technology requires addressing its environmental and social impacts and ensuring that it benefits all.
