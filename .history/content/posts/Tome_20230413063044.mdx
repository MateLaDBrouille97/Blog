# What is Tome ?
<br/>
I'm always on the lookout for innovative tools that can shake up the way we create and share presentations. Recently, I stumbled upon Tome, a presentation builder designed specifically for the mobile-first generation. It's all about conveying big ideas through sleek and multifaceted digital collages that look stunning on any device.
<br/>
Now, I'll be honest, Tome is still in beta and has some room for improvement when it comes to customization options like fonts and colors. But what really caught my attention are its integration capabilities. With Tome, you can seamlessly embed public websites directly into your presentation, eliminating the hassle of resizing images or formatting. This means you can easily integrate custom visuals and websites from popular platforms like Figma, Miro, Giphy, and Twitter, and they remain interactive without any distortion. Plus, Tome also allows for annotations within the presentation, making it a breeze for teammates to offer feedback directly on slides. And let's not forget the video introduction capabilities for each slide, allowing for awesome voice-over narrations!
<br/>
But what truly excites me about Tome is its potential to become the new standard for professional presentations. Its collaborative nature, flexibility, and integration capabilities make it a game-changer. I can't wait to see a more connected, digital-first approach to presentations that reflect the collaged styles of modern digital life. And it's not just Tome, but a growing trend of synchronous collaborative software in other areas of digital documentation like Notion and Miro. Younger users, who are already accustomed to digital-first tools like Google Docs and Wikipedia, are craving connected notes and feedback.
<br/>
In conclusion, Tome is a promising presentation builder with fantastic features and integration capabilities. While it's still in beta and has room for improvement, I'm hopeful for a future where presentation software becomes more collaborative, flexible, and reflective of the preferences and needs of the digital-first generation. So, if you're looking to revolutionize your presentations, Tome might just be the game-changing tool you've been waiting for!
