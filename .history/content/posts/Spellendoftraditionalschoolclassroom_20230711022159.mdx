According to Professor Stuart Russell, a leading expert on AI at the University of California, Berkeley, recent advances in AI technology could bring about the end of traditional school classrooms. He believes that personalized AI tutors, similar to ChatGPT, have the potential to revolutionize education by providing tailored instruction to every household with a smartphone. Russell suggests that this technology could deliver most of the material taught in high schools, potentially transforming education worldwide.
<br/>
While personalized tutoring has been shown to be more effective than traditional classroom teaching, Russell acknowledges that deploying AI in education comes with risks. There is concern about the potential for indoctrination and the displacement of teachers. However, he emphasizes that human involvement will still be essential, albeit in a different capacity. Teachers could take on roles such as facilitating complex activities, delivering moral education, and ensuring the preservation and improvement of the social aspects of childhood.
<br/>
OpenAI is already exploring educational applications of AI, as evidenced by their partnership with the Khan Academy to develop a virtual tutor powered by ChatGPT-4. However, the use of AI in education requires careful risk assessment, addressing concerns about hijacking by authoritarian regimes and the need to preserve the social and collaborative aspects of learning.
<br/>
Russell also discusses the broader existential risks posed by AI. He highlights the need for policymakers to engage with the issue and find ways to regulate and control AI systems. The challenge lies in quantifying the risks and preventing systems from going rogue. The opacity of large language models and their internal workings presents additional uncertainty. Russell warns of potential consequences, including unforeseen shifts in global opinion and political tendencies, as AI technology becomes more pervasive.
<br/>
While AI-powered personalized tutoring holds great promise for transforming education, there are risks and challenges that need to be carefully considered and addressed. The role of teachers will likely evolve, but human involvement and the preservation of social aspects in education remain crucial. Moreover, the broader implications and risks of AI, including those beyond education, require serious attention from policymakers.
