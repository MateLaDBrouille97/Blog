<br />
The BRICS summit, comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, is taking place in Johannesburg. This bloc represents 40% of the global population and over 25% of the world's GDP, positioning itself as an economic counterbalance to Western influence. Coined by economist Jim O'Neill in 2001, BRIC initially represented Brazil, Russia, India, and China, later joined by South Africa. The group aimed to enhance the influence of these emerging economies on the global stage. In 2015, they established the New Development Bank (NDB) to fund development projects in BRICS nations and other emerging economies, headquartered in Shanghai.
<br />
The BRICS countries collectively hold a significant portion of the world's land and population, with India and China accounting for nearly 3 billion people combined. Their combined GDP constitutes just over a quarter of the global economy. However, there are notable economic disparities within the bloc. Russia and Brazil's economic shares have regressed to their 2001 levels after a period of rapid growth, prompting suggestions that the group could have been named the "IC" (India and China) or simply the "C."
<br />
Amid growing interest, potential expansion is being discussed, with Saudi Arabia, Iran, Argentina, and Egypt seeking BRICS membership. The BRICS summit remains a platform for these nations to collaborate, present their economies' strengths, and address global economic concerns.

# ***The Rise of the BRICS***
<br/>
<Image src="/BRICS-GDP.jpeg" alt="" width={600} height={500} />
<br />
Over the past two decades, the rise of the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) has introduced a significant counterbalance to the traditional dominance of the G7 (United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Japan). The BRICS countries, driven by rapid economic growth and development, have gained collective influence and ambition. China's remarkable economic ascent, characterized by manufacturing strength, a large consumer market, and innovation-driven growth, has particularly reshaped global trade and investment. Despite Russia, Brazil, and South Africa falling short of initial expectations, the combined GDP of BRICS surpassed the G7's in 2020 when measured at purchasing power parity. BRICS nations are projected to collectively account for 32.1% of global GDP in 2023, up from 16.9% in 1995, exceeding the G7's 29.9% share.
<br/>
The rise of BRICS has led to calls for more inclusive and representative global governance, challenging the policies of the Western-led G7. This divergence became evident in their responses to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. While the G7 condemned the attack and imposed sanctions, none of the BRICS members denounced Russia's actions or participated in the sanctions. The BRICS summit discussions have included the potential expansion of the bloc. While disparities exist within the group, the collective growth and influence of BRICS have reshaped the global economic and geopolitical landscape, presenting an alternative perspective to the dominance of the G7.

<br />
Amid the ongoing recovery from the pandemic's impact on the global economy, the upcoming BRICS Summit has garnered attention as the world looks to these nations – Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa – for solutions to various challenges. The current landscape is marred by factors like the Russia-Ukraine conflict, supply chain disruptions, and widespread inflation. These countries, accounting for a quarter of the global economy and over 40% of the world's population, are seen as stabilizers in regional development and global supply chains.
<br/>
The BRICS nations are focusing on fostering economic and trade cooperation to drive global economic revival. Despite the pandemic, China's trade with these partners expanded significantly in 2021. China remained Brazil's top trading partner, while trade with Russia and India also grew substantially. The group's economic and trade collaboration has not only benefited individual member nations but also emerged as a crucial engine for global economic recovery.
<br/>
Apart from trade, BRICS countries have made strides in finance and development through the New Development Bank (NDB), established in 2015. The NDB has financed numerous infrastructure and sustainable development projects, with plans to allocate $30 billion for member countries from 2022 to 2026, a portion earmarked for climate change efforts. Moreover, the BRICS bloc has seen expansion in shared economy initiatives and mobile payments, leveraging their large population for a thriving consumer market and digital economy.

<br/>
<Image src="/Animated Chart_ BRICS.png" alt="" width={600} height={500} />
<br />
The G7, initially comprising the US, UK, West Germany, France, and others, emerged 50 years ago to address the international monetary situation. It expanded to include Japan, Italy, and Canada, representing major non-communist economies. The newer BRICS group (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) has gained significance, with their collective GDP share rising from 16.45% in 1992 to 31.67% in 2022. China and India's growth fueled BRICS' rise, with China becoming the world's second-largest economy due to WTO entry. By 2023, BRICS' PPP-adjusted GDP exceeded G7's. By 2028, BRICS is projected to constitute one-third of the global economy. This shift holds geopolitical implications, while G7 maintains influence.

<br/>
<Image src="/3b419ec1cc6c4d1babd6600657cb11ff.jpg" alt="" width={600} height={500} />
<br />
Over the past decade, the BRICS countries – Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa – have emphasized the importance of "energy security," which refers to consistent and affordable energy availability for sustained socio-economic growth. The International Energy Agency (IEA) states that BRICS nations contribute to 36.4% of the global primary energy supply, a figure projected to rise to 40–50% by 2040. This marks a substantial 11.6% increase from 2000 to 2017, surpassing the growth of OECD countries.
<br/>
<Image src="/0c02826f46944316bafa8d8e4cf6e547.jpg" alt="" width={600} height={500} />
<br />
Renewable energy has also gained ground within the BRICS framework, with a remarkable 161% increase in installed capacity over the last decade, comprising 43.1% of global capacity. Notably, these countries encompass both major energy producers (like Russia) and voracious consumers (like China and India). China, in particular, is a frontrunner in the clean energy sector, investing significantly in renewables, leading global solar panel and wind turbine production, and contributing 45% of the world's green energy investment in 2017.
<br/>
<Image src="/d6750469eb16492386245454796bcd46.jpg" alt="" width={600} height={500} />
<br />
These developments are bolstered by the fact that the "Big Three" BRICS countries – China, Brazil, and India – have collectively invested $177 billion in renewable energy, showcasing their commitment to sustainable practices. Even South Africa, as the most prosperous African nation, has embraced clean energy transition, thanks to its abundance of renewable resources.
<br/>
<Image src="/fc0fe7c841744109808a22058d1cf599.jpg" alt="" width={600} height={500} />
<br />
As the world witnesses a shift from fossil fuels to renewables, this transformation is predicted to reshape global politics, influencing power dynamics, inter-state relations, and geopolitical stability. As these nations continue to leverage renewable energy for cooperation, the BRICS consortium is poised to thrive in the years ahead.

# ***Who Is Building Nuclear Reactors?***
<br/>
<Image src="/who-is-building-nuclear-reactors.jpg" alt="" width={600} height={500} />
<br />
Nuclear power is experiencing a resurgence as nations seek dependable and eco-friendly energy sources to complement renewables. Despite a slump after Japan's Fukushima incident in the 2010s, the pursuit of clean energy is revitalizing the sector. Numerous countries are constructing new reactors or revitalizing existing ones. Globally, there are around 440 operational nuclear reactors generating roughly 10% of the world's power annually. The US possesses 93 reactors, contributing over 30% of global nuclear power, while France's nuclear plants supply 70% of its yearly electricity.
<br/>
China has significantly expanded its nuclear industry, elevating its reactor count from 13 in 2010 to 53 in 2021, coupled with a fivefold growth in capacity. India's nuclear capacity is less than the UK's, despite having 10 more reactors, mainly due to its smaller reactor sizes. A large portion of the world's reactors, about 280 out of 440, are over 30 years old, spurring the construction of new reactors to support this aging fleet.
<br/>
The bulk of new reactors are being erected in Asia, with China and India leading the way. China is focusing on nuclear power as it moves away from coal, with 21 reactors in progress and plans to boost nuclear capacity by over 40% by 2030. India is also expanding its capacity, with eight reactors under construction. Moreover, India aims to develop a thorium-fueled reactor to harness its abundant thorium resources.
<br/>
In Asia (excluding Russia), 36 out of 59 reactors under construction are located. Additionally, Turkey is entering the nuclear arena with four reactors, and the UK is building substantial reactors with capacities of 1,720 MWe each. This nuclear resurgence aligns with the global shift towards cleaner and more sustainable energy solutions.

# ***China’s Energy Demand Sees Coal and Renewables Soar***
<br/>
<Image src="/24544.jpeg" alt="" width={600} height={500} />
<br />
According to Ember's Global Electricity Review, in 2020, over half of the world's coal-powered electricity was generated in China. This surge in energy demand in China has led to a substantial increase in both coal-based and renewable electricity production. Between 2000 and 2020, China's coal-based electricity generation grew more than fourfold to about 4,600 terrawatt hours, while renewable electricity production increased tenfold but reached only around 2,200 terrawatt hours. This highlights China's ongoing reliance on coal despite its progress in renewables.
<br/>
China's substantial investment in coal power has boosted the technology over the past two decades, even as other regions have been phasing out coal-fired capacities. While Europe has been transitioning away from coal and other fossil fuels, the situation is less clear in the United States, which has reduced coal usage but increased reliance on slightly cleaner fossil fuel sources like oil and gas.
<br/>
Unlike many countries that use a mix of fossil fuels for electricity, China has primarily invested in coal and renewables. As renewable energy grows faster than coal in China, the coal-based electricity share is decreasing, outpacing the global average rate.
<br/>
Renewables are now the second-largest and fastest-growing source of global electricity, doubling capacity over the past 20 years. Meanwhile, coal-based power increased by around 50%, with oil and gas growing at a slower pace of about 25%. Apart from the US, Russia, Japan, Iran, and Mexico also heavily rely on oil and gas for electricity generation. In 2020, about 90% of the world's electricity was produced using coal, oil, gas, and renewable sources combined.

# ***Visualizing China’s Energy Transition in 5 Charts***
<br/>
<Image src="/VCE-Chinas-Plan-to-Go-Green-v1.8.jpg" alt="" width={600} height={500} />
<br />
China's President Xi Jinping announced China's commitment to achieving carbon neutrality by 2060 at the UN Assembly in 2020. This infographic outlines China's ambitious plan to transform its energy sector and the progress made towards this goal. Currently, 80% of China's energy is sourced from fossil fuels, but the plan envisions reducing this to just 14% by 2060.
<br/>
The transition involves significant changes, comparable in scale to China's initial industrialization. China leads in electricity consumption globally, surpassing even the US. The plan projects that coal, oil, and natural gas will decrease dramatically by 2060. Meanwhile, renewable sources like wind, nuclear, solar, hydro, and biomass will see substantial growth.
<br/>
The 14th five-year plan aligns with Xi's goal, emphasizing clean energy initiatives like clean energy centers, nuclear power, and electricity transmission. China has made strides in reducing coal use, increasing nuclear and solar capacity, and shifting towards electric energy. Urbanization has spurred higher electricity demand, expected to reach 40% of total energy consumption by 2030.
<br/>
The transition poses challenges due to China's industrial infrastructure, but its investments in low-carbon technology and strong government guidance offer potential. China's choices will significantly impact global environmental health and influence other countries' energy transitions. The journey towards carbon neutrality is closely monitored on the global stage, underscoring China's pivotal role in shaping the world's energy future.

# ***Overview of the Brazilian Energy Market***
<br/>
<Image src="/diagram_1-en-1536x806.jpeg" alt="" width={600} height={500} />
<br />
Brazilian energy market faces significant challenges in meeting consumer demand for electrical power while maintaining safety and cost-effectiveness. The country's energy generation is predominantly sourced from hydroelectric power (66.1%), followed by thermo-electric power (22.7%), wind farms, and energy imports. The National System Operator manages generation levels and coordinates transmission facilities through a centralized model. The National Interconnected System spans over 140,000 km of transmission lines, interconnecting regional energy systems to optimize resources.
<br/>
Brazil's extensive renewable energy potential is a key focus, with hydroelectricity being the dominant source. The transition to decarbonization has impacted the energy landscape due to the increased use of uncontrollable sources. Wind farms, particularly in the northeast and south, have grown to meet demand. Thermal power plants complement hydroelectric plants and enhance the stability of the National Interconnected System.
<br/>
Electricity distribution involves companies that receive high-voltage power from the transmission system and deliver it to consumers. Distribution is regulated, and there's a division between the Regulated Contracting Environment and the Free Contracting Environment. In the former, captive consumers buy energy from distribution companies, while the latter allows negotiation between generators, importers, exporters, and consumers.
<br/>
Key authorities include the Ministry of Mines and Energy, Energy Research Company, National Electric Energy Agency, National Power System Operator, and Council for Purchase and Sale of Electrical Energy. Rates consist of sector charges, taxes, distribution, transmission, and generation costs, with taxes and charges forming a substantial portion of the bill. The "Spot Market" handles contract registration and calculates differences in contracted and actual generation and consumption. The Price of Settlement of Differences optimizes water use and future fuel savings in the hydro-thermal dispatch, adapting to an increasingly diverse energy matrix.

# ***South Africa at a crossroads: Options for the future power mix***
<br/>
<Image src="/Slider_Elec_gas_fig1-300x212.png" alt="" width={600} height={500} />
<br />
In 2018, South Africa's power sector faced challenges including Eskom, the state-owned utility, grappling with mounting debt and a credit rating decline. Power shortages and scheduled load shedding resulted from strained coal supply and power plant utilization. This prompted discussions about reform and a shift in the energy mix. The Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) draft proposes transitioning from coal and nuclear to gas and renewables, though coal's economic significance complicates diversification decisions.
<br/>
IHS Markit evaluated five key variables for potential pathways:
1. Power plant retirement: Uncertainty surrounds Eskom's coal unit retirement schedule, impacting supply-demand balance.
2. Coal supply and investment: Delays and cost overruns in projects like Medupi and Kusile risk future coal financing. Demand for low-calorific coal rises while mine investments lag.
3. Clean energy targets: The IRP aims for 18 GW of solar and wind capacity by 2030, hindered by transmission delays. Carbon Tax Bill and IPP program support renewables.
4. Natural gas: Gas expansion depends on securing supply from indigenous sources, East Africa, and LNG imports.
5. Political and social pressures: Coal contributes to exports, jobs, and energy independence. Labor unions exert pressure.
<br/>
Two power supply options emerged: 
1. Independent case: Extend coal fleet life while incrementally introducing gas. Risk of coal unit failures and capital-intensive investments.
2. Interconnected case: Early coal retirement and rapid shift to gas with long-term supply contracts.
<br/>
Regardless, challenges in South Africa's power sector dynamics, technology costs, coal supply, and gas markets require an integrated strategy to achieve IRP goals.

# ***Which Countries are Buying Russian Fossil Fuels?***
<br/>
<Image src="/Whos-Been-Buying-Russian-Fossil-Fuels-Mar-1.jpg" alt="" width={600} height={500} />
<br />
Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, its fossil fuel exports have continued, generating over $315 billion in revenue, with the EU accounting for nearly half of it. China tops the list of buyers, importing mainly crude oil, totaling over $66 billion. Germany follows, primarily importing natural gas worth over $12 billion. Turkey, a non-EU NATO member, closely trails Germany due to its exemption from EU import bans, likely overtaking it soon.
<br/>
Although EU nations and other European countries have reduced Russian fossil fuel imports due to bans and price caps, India increased its imports to $81 million daily, but this doesn't offset the EU's $655 million import reduction. African nations' doubled imports haven't prevented a 21% decline in Russian seaborne oil product exports. Overall, Russian fossil fuel revenues fell by over 50%, from a peak of $1.17 billion daily to $560 million, influenced by EU reductions and a nearly 50% drop in crude oil prices since the invasion.
<br/>
The future trajectory remains uncertain, compounded by the EU's 10th set of sanctions banning imports of bitumen and related materials, projected to cost Russia almost $1.4 billion in export revenues. This complex interplay of geopolitical events, import bans, price fluctuations, and global dynamics shapes the landscape of Russian fossil fuel exports and revenues.

# ***Visualizing China’s $18 Trillion Economy in One Chart***
<br/>
<Image src="/Visualizing-Chinas-Economy-By-Sector-in-2021.jpg" alt="" width={600} height={500} />
<br />
In 2021, China's economy reached a GDP of ¥114 trillion ($18 trillion USD), surpassing government growth targets with an 8.1% expansion. The country's modern economy is diversified across sectors. Industrial production, including manufacturing, mining, and utilities, led the way with ¥37.3 trillion ($5.9 trillion USD), contributing a significant 32.6% to the economy. Wholesale and retail trades followed with ¥10.5 trillion ($1.7 trillion USD), representing 9.2%. Finance, farming, construction, real estate, and various services also contributed to the economic landscape.
<br/>
China's GDP growth history reveals stability before the pandemic, with quarterly growth just above 5%. Despite COVID-19's initial impact, China's economy rebounded in 2021. However, renewed outbreaks led to new lockdowns, affecting GDP growth. The uncertain economic outlook continued into 2022 due to ongoing supply chain issues and regional lockdowns, such as in Shanghai.
<br/>
China's unique zero-COVID policy aimed at strict lockdowns to control outbreaks. This strategy initially supported GDP growth, but challenges arose with the Omicron variant. Despite high vaccination rates and lockdowns, the variant reached various provinces and cities. Notably, industrial production remained robust due to factories being situated in suburban areas, while sectors like hospitality suffered from lockdowns.
<br/>
As many countries shift to living with COVID, China's continued adherence to a zero-COVID policy raises questions about its economic prospects. Whether the country can maintain its rapid growth or if the policy will hinder recovery remains uncertain. China's economy, currently the world's second-largest, holds the potential to become the largest in the coming decades, though challenges lie ahead, especially considering the evolving global pandemic situation.

Financial companies dominate, including HDFC, ICICI Bank, Bajaj Finance, Kotak Mahindra Bank, and State Bank of India. This sector's prominence highlights India's economic shift.
<br/>
India's agricultural sector, the world's largest milk and second-largest tea producer, contributes 18.1% of GDP. Services (55.6%) and industry (26.3%) lead. Looking forward, India's economic landscape is likely to evolve further, potentially altering the roster of top companies. Despite this change, India's continued growth trajectory seems certain, powered by a diverse economic mix and its burgeoning population.

<br/>
Brazil, a prominent member of the BRICS group, boasts a diverse and powerful economy. The country's top 10 largest public companies by market capitalization in October 2021 reflect its economic strength. Leading the list is Vale, a mining giant that dominates in iron ore and nickel production, while also managing significant infrastructure assets like hydroelectric plants and transportation networks. Following closely is Petróleo Brasileiro, the nation's largest oil producer, previously state-owned and privatized in the 1990s.
<br/>
Brazil's economic landscape showcases its robust financial sector, with five out of the top 10 companies having market caps exceeding $20 billion operating in banking. Noteworthy among these are Itaú Unibanco, the largest bank in the Southern Hemisphere, and Banco Santander Brasil, the Brazilian arm of a Spanish finance corporation. The list also features Ambev, a prominent brewing company responsible for the majority of Brazil's alcoholic beverages production and a vital part of the global Anheuser-Busch InBev conglomerate.
<br/>
Interestingly, the top 10 list lacks major agricultural players, despite Brazil's status as the world's leading exporter of coffee, soybeans, beef, and ethanol. The nation's agricultural industry links to various multinational corporations, though concerns about Amazon deforestation have drawn attention to their supply chains.
<br/>
Overall, Brazil's economy thrives on a mix of mining, energy production, finance, and beverage manufacturing, contributing to its position as one of the world's economic powerhouses. The country's diverse industries underscore its global significance beyond its abundant natural resources.

<br/>
Despite the pandemic's challenges, strong South African brands have resiliently upheld the economy, with the combined brand value of the top 50 decreasing by only 2% (R8.8 billion), not the predicted 15%. Banking (23%), telecoms (18%), and retail (13%) sectors contribute most to the R462.4 billion brand value, with MTN retaining its top position at R44.8 billion. Capitec earns the title of South Africa's strongest brand due to its AAA rating. The Johannesburg Stock Exchange recovered within 15 months. New entrants include Sibanye Stillwater, Markham, Spar SA, Media24, and Dis-Chem. Retail grew by 36%, while apparel brands like Markham surged by 44%, in contrast to Country Road's 39% fall.

# BRICS +

# ***An expanded BRICS could reset world politics but picking new members isn’t straightforward***
<br/>
Several countries, primarily from the global south, are seeking to join the Brics bloc (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) as a way to counter perceived Western dominance. Originally coined as BRIC in 2001, the bloc now aims to represent 45% of global GDP by 2030 and has taken on a more political role beyond its economic origins. The group's internal cohesion has strengthened, focusing on reforming global institutions. However, expanding the bloc faces challenges as potential new members need to harmonize their vision and the current members must be selective.
<br/>
The political character of BRICS draws from a history of non-alignment, countering the influence of the US and its allies in global affairs. Over 40 states aspire to join BRICS, with motivations including challenging US hegemony and accessing funds from the BRICS New Development Bank, particularly vital in the post-COVID economic landscape.
<br/>
The expansion would be significant, especially in economic terms, with priorities like reducing reliance on the US dollar. However, the current members need to be cautious about whom they admit. Considerations include applicants' track records and their relationships with existing members. Saudi Arabia and Mexico might face challenges due to their ties to the US. Cuba, with strong connections to existing members and a history of countering US influence, appears to be a suitable ideological fit.
<br/>
An expanded BRICS could be an agent for global change, but careful selection and maintaining unity among members are crucial for its success and impact on the world stage.

# ***BRICS Group Announces New Members, Expanding Its Reach***
<br/>
<Image src="/24brics-jklf-superJumbo.jpeg" alt="" width={600} height={500} />
<br/>
At the BRICS summit held in Johannesburg, the bloc of emerging nations, which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, made a significant decision regarding its future direction. The group was at a crossroads, debating whether to align more closely with Western-dominated systems or embrace a stronger anti-West stance led by China. The summit concluded with the inclusion of six new countries—Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia. The addition of these nations enhances the group's financial strength and bolsters China's efforts to demonstrate growing global support for its agenda.
<br/>
The inclusion of Iran in the BRICS group signals a more anti-American stance and emphasizes Chinese influence over the concerns of India and Brazil, which sought to maintain Western ties. However, this move is not without complications, potentially increasing geopolitical tensions with Western powers. China's push for Indonesia's membership was unsuccessful, highlighting limitations to its influence.
<br/>
The expansion reflects BRICS' transition from an economic forum to a more geopolitically oriented entity, responding to the China-US rivalry and global power dynamics. The inclusion of countries with diverse governance systems—ranging from democracies to authoritarian states—raises concerns about the group's effectiveness and unity.
<br/>
While some view the expansion as a success for China, others argue that the BRICS bloc risks becoming unwieldy and less effective due to divergent interests among its members. The move is seen as an attempt by emerging nations to challenge Western-dominated institutions and seek alternatives in an evolving global landscape.

<br/>
During the three-day annual summit of major emerging economies in Johannesburg, discussions about expansion have taken center stage. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that Saudi Arabia, Iran, Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates have been invited to join the BRICS group as full members from January 1 next year. BRICS currently consists of China, Brazil, South Africa, Russia, and India. The expansion was agreed upon by the core group after more than a year of discussions. This move is seen as an effort to create a "multipolar" world order, placing the voices of the Global South at the forefront of global governance.
<br/>
Leaders from various countries have welcomed this historic expansion. Chinese President Xi Jinping stated that the move would bring new vigor to BRICS cooperation and strengthen global peace and development. Iran considered its admission as a historic development for its foreign policy, while Saudi Arabia's foreign minister expressed the kingdom's willingness to cooperate and review the invitation.
<br/>
The inclusion of Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Iran, and Egypt marks the first representation from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region in BRICS. The expansion was driven by Russia and China, possibly due to Western sanctions. However, experts note that despite the expansion, BRICS' effectiveness in global governance has been limited by differing political and social interests among its members. Over 40 countries expressed interest in joining BRICS, with 23 formally applying. The summit, attended by more than 50 heads of state and leaders, concluded with a focus on reshaping global governance dynamics.
