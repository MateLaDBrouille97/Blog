<br/>
A new and previously unidentified cyber threat actor, referred to as Sandman, has emerged, carrying out a series of cyberattacks on telecommunication providers in the Middle East, Western Europe, and South Asia. These attacks involve the use of a just-in-time (JIT) compiler for the Lua programming language, known as LuaJIT, to deploy a newly discovered implant named LuaDream. Security researchers, including Aleksandar Milenkoski from SentinelOne, have noted the strategic nature of these attacks, with an emphasis on minimizing detection while achieving specific objectives.
<br/>
The Sandman threat actor has not been linked to any known group, but evidence suggests a focus on cyber espionage targeting the telecom sector across regions. These attacks were first detected in August 2023, and the LuaDream implant is designed to avoid detection by deploying malware directly into memory through LuaJIT.
<br/>
While Lua-based malware is relatively rare, LuaDream shares similarities with a malware strain called DreamLand identified by Kaspersky. LuaDream functions as a modular, multi-protocol backdoor with anti-debugging capabilities. It can exfiltrate system and user information and execute attacker-provided plugins, expanding its functionality. Command-and-control communication is established through various protocols, including WebSocket.
<br/>
The exact method of initial access remains unclear, but Sandman has been observed stealing administrative credentials and conducting reconnaissance to breach targeted workstations. This attack represents an example of continuous innovation in cyber espionage efforts.
<br/>
Coinciding with this revelation, SentinelOne reported sustained intrusions by Chinese threat actors in Africa targeting telecommunications, finance, and government sectors. These activities aim to extend China's influence and align with its geopolitical ambitions.
<br/>
In a related development, Cisco Talos disclosed a new intrusion set called ShroudedSnooper targeting telecommunication service providers in the Middle East, utilizing stealthy backdoors like HTTPSnoop and PipeSnoop.
<br/>
These incidents highlight the evolving and dynamic nature of cyber threats, emphasizing the importance of robust cybersecurity measures and constant vigilance in the face of emerging threat actors and tactics.

# ***Kroll Suffers Data Breach: Employee Falls Victim to SIM Swapping Attack***
<br/>
Risk advisory provider Kroll recently revealed that one of its employees fell victim to a sophisticated SIM swapping attack on August 19, 2023. The attack targeted the employee's T-Mobile account, where T-Mobile transferred the employee's phone number to the attacker's device without authorization. This allowed the attacker to access sensitive files containing personal information of bankruptcy claimants related to BlockFi, FTX, and Genesis.
<br/>
SIM swapping, typically a legitimate process, can be exploited by malicious actors to fraudulently take control of a victim's phone number. By doing so, attackers can intercept SMS messages, voice calls, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) messages, thereby gaining access to online accounts. These attacks often involve the collection of personal information through phishing or social engineering to convince cellular carriers to transfer the victim's number to the attacker's SIM card.
<br/>
Kroll took immediate action to secure the affected accounts and notified impacted individuals. Currently, there is no evidence of additional compromised systems or accounts. This incident follows a recent lawsuit filed by Bart Stephens, co-founder of Blockchain Capital, against an anonymous hacker who allegedly stole $6.3 million in cryptocurrency through a SIM swap attack. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB) has also urged telecommunications providers to implement stronger security measures against SIM swapping, including enhanced identity verification and customer account locking options.
<br/>
In light of these incidents, it's essential for users to reconsider SMS-based two-factor authentication (2FA) and adopt more secure authentication methods to protect their online accounts from the growing threat of SIM swapping attacks. This serves as a reminder of the need for robust cybersecurity measures in an increasingly connected world.

# ***Are You Willing to Pay the High Cost of Compromised Credentials?***
<br/>
Weak password policies can leave organizations vulnerable to cyberattacks. While standard password complexity requirements are in place to enhance security, a surprising 83% of compromised passwords still meet these standards. This is because cybercriminals have access to vast numbers of stolen credentials, which they can reuse to breach additional accounts. To bolster password security, organizations must go beyond complexity requirements and actively block the use of compromised credentials.
<br/>
Stolen credentials are readily available on the dark web, often following high-profile breaches like those of Dropbox and LinkedIn, which resulted in millions of passwords being sold in underground markets. Credential stuffing, a favored attack method, involves using stolen login information to gain unauthorized access to accounts. As the number of stolen credentials continues to rise, there are increasingly more opportunities for attackers to exploit this method.
<br/>
Attackers employ automated tools to test stolen credentials across multiple sites. They utilize readily available tools that match passwords with specific websites, especially if the password contains the site's name. Sophisticated bots, which can mimic unique IP addresses, are commonly used to evade security measures.
<br/>
Once a successful login is achieved, attackers can empty accounts, steal sensitive information, send phishing messages, or traffic stolen data on the dark web. This type of attack has surged in popularity due to users reusing passwords across multiple accounts, with one analysis revealing that 44 million Microsoft users reused passwords in a three-month period.
<br/>
To defend against this growing threat, organizations should promptly detect compromised passwords and notify affected accounts. Tools like Specops Password Auditor can help identify vulnerabilities and compromised passwords within Active Directory. Specops Password Policy enables organizations to implement stringent password policies and scan against a database of over 4 billion compromised passwords. Continuous scanning provides real-time alerts when passwords are compromised, offering ongoing protection.
<br/>
To safeguard their credentials, organizations must take proactive steps to prevent future credential stuffing attacks. By utilizing tools like Specops Password Policy and Specops Password Auditor, they can strengthen their password security and avoid the costly consequences of compromised credentials.
