China has responded to the Biden administration's imposition of new restrictions on advanced chip exports, alleging a violation of market economy and fair competition principles. These measures focus on chipmaking tools and advanced chips, including those from Nvidia, a leading player in the market. The move aims to close loopholes identified after the initial round of chip controls implemented in October. The U.S. argues that these restrictions are designed to prevent China from gaining access to cutting-edge technologies that could enhance its military capabilities, particularly in artificial intelligence (AI). Despite U.S. assurances that the move is not economically punitive, China's foreign ministry sees it as a "forced decoupling for political purposes."
<br/>
As a consequence, Chinese stock markets featuring chip-related companies have experienced modest declines, with the CSI Semiconductor Index falling by 1.4%, the STAR Chip Index by 1.2%, and an index tracking China's AI firms by 1.8%. U.S. chip stocks, including Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, also saw declines due to these restrictions. Nvidia, in particular, will be severely affected, as approximately 25% of its data center chip sales revenue comes from China. The Semiconductor Industry Association expressed concerns that the measures are overly broad and could harm the U.S. semiconductor ecosystem without advancing national security.
<br/>
This back-and-forth trade spat highlights resource nationalism concerns as both the U.S. and China impose restrictions on critical materials used in semiconductor production, such as gallium and germanium. These actions have the potential to disrupt the global semiconductor supply chain and may lead to increased tensions in the high-tech industry.

# ***US Imposes New Chip Export Controls on China***
<br/>
The U.S. Commerce Department has implemented tighter export controls on advanced computer chips to prevent China from obtaining technology that could be used for developing hypersonic missiles and artificial intelligence, citing national security and human rights concerns. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo stated that these controls aim to safeguard technologies with significant implications for national security and human rights. Although the majority of semiconductor sales to China will remain unaffected, these restrictions could escalate tensions between the U.S. and China.
<br/>
The new measures enable the monitoring of chip sales that could still be repurposed for military applications, even if they do not meet specific trade limitation thresholds. Additionally, chip exports can now be restricted to companies based in Macao or countries under U.S. arms embargoes to prevent circumvention of controls. The updated restrictions also make it harder for China to manufacture advanced chips abroad and expand the list of manufacturing equipment subject to export controls.
<br/>
China had protested last year's export controls, considering high-level semiconductor design and manufacture crucial for its economic growth. Raimondo clarified that the limitations on these chips are not meant to harm China's economy. The move comes amidst diplomatic efforts to improve U.S.-China relations, with President Joe Biden considering a potential meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in San Francisco in November.
<br/>
The U.S. Commerce Department has imposed stricter export controls on computer chips destined for China, targeting technologies with national security and human rights implications. This action may strain U.S.-China relations and affects chip sales and manufacturing, while diplomatic engagements continue between the two nations.

# ***China rebukes U.S. over latest chip restrictions***
<br/>
China has strongly criticized the United States for imposing new restrictions on chip exports, further escalating tensions in the ongoing technology and trade dispute. The Chinese foreign ministry responded to the Biden administration's measures by asserting that such restrictions and "forced de-coupling for political purposes" contradict the principles of a market economy and fair competition. While the U.S. has claimed it doesn't aim to hinder China's economic growth, China expressed hope that the U.S. would maintain this commitment instead of making contradictory statements.
<br/>
The U.S. announced its intention to cease shipments of advanced artificial intelligence chips, including those produced by Nvidia, to China. It also expanded the restrictions on advanced chips and chipmaking tools to additional countries, including Iran and Russia. Furthermore, Chinese chip designers Moore Threads and Biren were blacklisted. In response to the announcement, China's semiconductor and AI-related stocks experienced declines. Analysts suggest that while some Chinese AI companies may face limited disruption due to prior preparations and chip stockpiling, the long-term impact could widen the gap between China and global peers in the AI sector.
<br/>
These restrictions may also promote China's self-sufficiency agenda, which President Xi Jinping has been advocating. They not only affect Nvidia's ability to sell AI chips in China but also prevent advanced technology from being used to manufacture chips designed by Chinese startups founded by Nvidia veterans. Biren and Moore Threads are evaluating the impact and may appeal to the U.S. government to reconsider its decision. The latest measures reflect the growing tensions between the U.S. and China in the realm of technology and trade.

# ***The EU’s Chips Act enters into force: Here’s what it means***
<br/>
The EU's Chips Act, which recently came into effect, marks a significant move to strengthen the European Union's semiconductor industry. Semiconductors are vital components in electronic devices, from smartphones and cars to healthcare, clean energy, and communication technologies. The law is driven by the need to reduce the EU's reliance on foreign suppliers, particularly China, Taiwan for manufacturing, and the US for design, which was exacerbated during the pandemic.
<br/>
The Chips Act has three core objectives: enhancing domestic manufacturing capacity, promoting the European design ecosystem, and supporting innovation across the entire value chain. The EU aims to mobilize €43 billion in public and private investments and increase its global production capacity share from 10% to 20% by 2030.
<br/>
Key actions under the Act include the "Chips for Europe Initiative," which receives €3.3 billion in EU funding and aims to bridge the gap between research and industrialization. It will also create a Chips Fund to facilitate debt financing and equity for chip-related projects. To bolster production capacity, the Act will encourage private and public investments in manufacturing facilities for chipmakers and their suppliers. Additionally, it establishes a coordination mechanism between member states and the Commission to enhance collaboration, monitor supply, and address disruptions in the semiconductor supply chain.
<br/>
Commissioner Thierry Breton emphasized the ongoing investments, robust regulatory framework, and public funding, positioning the EU as an industrial powerhouse in the semiconductor market. The Act signifies Europe's commitment to securing its place in the global race for technological supremacy while supporting its values, sovereignty, and competitiveness in the semiconductor sector.
