Roy Geva Glasberg and Lee Moser, Managing Partners of AnD Ventures, discuss the rise of large language models (LLMs) in the investment world, emphasizing both their benefits and ethical considerations. LLMs, AI-powered programs that process language and generate content, have become popular tools for information accessibility and knowledge sharing. However, the authors stress that LLMs should not replace critical human interactions or decision-making processes in the investment domain.
<br/>
The authors acknowledge that LLMs can be valuable for basic market research and competitive analysis, leveraging publicly sourced information to identify potential investment opportunities. They share how their analysts have successfully used LLMs to find companies with similar products to their prospective startups, enhancing market research efforts significantly.
<br/>
Additionally, LLMs can serve as a middle ground for information transfer between different software platforms, helping bridge gaps and account for discrepancies during data exchange. Despite these advantages, the authors caution against using LLMs for aspects of the investment process that require full accuracy or original human perspectives, such as customer reviews, reference calls, and individual research.
<br/>
Furthermore, they emphasize the need to protect individual investor privacy and avoid using personal information within LLM programs. The authors conclude that while LLMs are not a complete solution, they have their purpose and can expedite the investment process and provide benefits when used appropriately.

# ***Opinion 10 things to consider before adopting AI technology in the OR***
<br/>
The integration of AI technology in hospital operating rooms (ORs) offers numerous potential benefits, but it requires careful consideration to ensure successful implementation. First, the value of the AI solution should outweigh any associated risks, costs, or drawbacks, and it should genuinely address existing problems or create new opportunities. Moreover, it must provide objective results, avoiding biased outcomes by using unbiased training data. Quality control measures should be in place to ensure accurate and reliable results, with regular maintenance and updates to keep up with best practices.
<br/>
Scalability is crucial as the hospital's volume of procedures and types increases, requiring AI solutions that can easily adapt to additional ORs and various specialties while delivering consistent care. Security and compliance with healthcare industry standards are paramount, ensuring patient data is de-identified, securely stored, and accessed only with proper authorization.
<br/>
Interoperability with existing IT infrastructure and easy integration into workflows are essential to minimize the burden on clinicians and IT administrators. Hospitals should retain ownership of their data while benefiting from benchmarking against global datasets, adhering to privacy policies.
<br/>
An AI solution's explainability is vital, allowing users to understand the rationale behind the results for accurate assessment. Additionally, hospital executives should evaluate the financial impact, ensuring cost-effectiveness and potential for improved efficiency and patient care.
<br/>
By carefully evaluating and implementing AI solutions, hospitals can harness the transformative power of AI to elevate surgical care, boost operational efficiency, and improve patient outcomes.

The financial industry is undergoing significant transformations due to fintech advancements. Five key trends are reshaping the industry in 2023 and beyond, as highlighted by Or Liban of Airwallex:
<br/>
1. Fintech Co-opetition: Collaboration and competition among fintech companies will be vital for achieving profitability. Strategic partnerships and collaborations will help fintech firms leverage each other's strengths and create a more competitive ecosystem.
<br/>
2. Embedded Finance: The appetite for Embedded finance and Banking-as-a-Service is growing, as businesses seek to attract and retain revenue. This trend is driven by the economic downturn, leading companies to offer payments and lending as upsell and cross-sell opportunities to clients. Israeli businesses need to adapt to remain competitive in this rapidly expanding market.
<br/>
3. Consolidation: To survive a challenging market with increased costs and reduced investment, fintech companies should consider consolidation. Collaborating and merging with other firms can open up new growth opportunities and ensure survival in a highly competitive landscape.
<br/>
4. Capital Efficiency and Treasury Products: Businesses are prioritizing cash flow predictability and capital efficiency, making treasury products more attractive to decision-makers. Israeli companies should explore these offerings to optimize financial operations and support growth.
<br/>
5. AI-Driven Risk Management: Generative AI has emerged as a powerful tool for both fraud detection and perpetration. Fintech companies should embrace AI-driven risk management to stay ahead of evolving financial crimes and ensure a secure ecosystem.
<br/>
To succeed in this rapidly evolving landscape, financial institutions, fintech companies, and regulators must adapt, collaborate, and embrace the transformative potential of fintech. By doing so, they can build a prosperous and resilient financial industry in Israel and beyond.
