# What is Hyperwrite ?
<br/>

Hyperwrite is an AI writing assistant developed by the team at OthersideAI.
The tool is designed to help writers improve their writing by providing personalized feedback and suggestions using GPT-3, the latest generation of AI technology. 
Hyperwrite also includes features such as research, organization, and editing assistance, a plagiarism checker, and over 50 templates to help writers generate content for various use cases. 
With a built-in plagiarism checker and a Chrome extension for added convenience, Hyperwrite helps ensure document originality and offers a seamless user experience.
To use Hyperwrite, writers need to sign up for an account and download a Chrome extension that works with several online platforms such as Google Docs, Gmail, Outlook, LinkedIn, Medium, and Notion. 
Hyperwrite is free to use, but it also offers two paid plans that provide users with more features and advanced AI support. 
Unfortunately, Hyperwrite currently only supports the English language and doesn't offer multilingual support, limiting its accessibility for non-English speaking users.
If you are constantly writing emails or blog posts, then Hyperwrite is definitely a tool you should check out.
