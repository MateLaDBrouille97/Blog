<p> Switzerland-based dental company, Straumann Group, is using machine learning and AI to turn its petabytes of data into an asset.
The aim is to transform the company's data and technology organisation into a data-as-a-service provider for the global manufacturer
and supplier of dental implants, prosthetics, orthodontics, and digital dentistry.
This will provide business stakeholders machine learning (ML) as a service. The companyâ€™s orthodontics business, for example, 
is heavily reliant on imaging data, leading to a growing volume of unstructured data. Straumann Group believes AI will play a critical
role in its image processing and lab treatments businesses. The company's information architects, in conjunction with business analysts,
are working on the semantic layer, which feeds data from data warehouses and data lakes into data marts. The next goal, with the aid of partner Findability Sciences,
will be to build out ML and AI pipelines into an information delivery layer that can support predictive and prescriptive analytics.
