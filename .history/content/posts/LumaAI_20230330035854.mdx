# How Does Luma AI Work?
<br/>
Luma AI uses Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to capture 3D images. NeRF is an AI-based technology that creates 3D models by predicting the color and appearance of each point in space. Essentially, NeRF is a type of neural network that uses deep learning to create high-quality 3D models.
<br/>
To use Luma AI, simply download the app and point your iPhone at the object or scene you wish to capture. The app will then use NeRF to capture a series of images from different angles, which are then combined to create a detailed 3D model.
