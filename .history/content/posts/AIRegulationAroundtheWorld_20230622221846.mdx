# Congress, White House race to get arms around AI systems 
<br/>
Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat from New York, plans to unveil a framework for regulating artificial intelligence (AI) development called "Safe Innovation in the AI Age." The framework aims to protect, expand, and harness the potential of AI while addressing its dangers. At the same time, a bipartisan group of lawmakers, led by Representative Ted Lieu, introduced legislation to establish a national commission tasked with studying AI and recommending regulatory actions. Lawmakers and the Biden administration are taking steps to catch up with AI advancements, prompted by concerns about unregulated AI systems and the need to maintain leadership in the field. The European Union has also passed draft legislation to regulate AI, but the US is cautious about moving too fast and potentially stifling innovation and competition.

### ***AI’s regulation naysayers protest too much*** ###
<br/>
The European Union (EU) is leading the way in regulating artificial intelligence (AI) with the proposed AI Act, while other countries are also working on their own rules. The rapid development of AI raises concerns about biases, copyright violations, and job displacement. However, defining and regulating AI is challenging due to its ability to independently draw conclusions and make decisions. Different countries have different approaches, with the EU, China, and Canada seeking comprehensive regulation, while India and the UK favor principles-based regulation. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman argues that the EU's proposed law imposes excessive requirements on general-purpose AI systems, potentially stifling innovation and favoring industry giants. Striking a balance between regulation and innovation is crucial in this evolving field.

### ***AI’s regulation naysayers protest too much*** ###
<br/>
The Australian government is taking steps to regulate artificial intelligence (AI) applications to ensure responsible and safe use. Concerns mainly revolve around generative AI, which uses large datasets to generate text, images, audio, or code in response to prompts. Fears include the creation of convincing deepfakes that could manipulate democratic processes or spread misinformation. There is also concern about algorithmic bias in decision-making AI systems, which can lead to discrimination or biased outcomes. The government aims to address these concerns through transparency, comprehensive dataset disclosure, and leveraging existing regulations related to privacy, consumer protection, online safety, competition, copyright, and discrimination. The paper acknowledges the potential benefits of AI in driving productivity growth, healthcare data analysis, engineering, and legal services optimization.

### ***UK PM Sunak pitches Britain as future home for AI regulation*** ###
<br/>
British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak emphasized that Britain could become a global leader in regulating artificial intelligence (AI) during his speech at the London Tech Week. He urged industry leaders to embrace the opportunities and challenges presented by AI and proposed London as a thriving tech hub. Sunak's government plans to host an AI summit later in the year to address the risks and regulation of AI. Sunak acknowledged the need to strike a balance between assessing and curbing potential negative consequences of AI while fostering innovation. He also gained support from U.S. President Joe Biden to host the AI summit, aiming to foster international coordination in addressing AI risks.

### ***What a Chinese Regulation Proposal Reveals About AI and Democratic Values*** ###
<br/>
China's recent draft regulation on regulating generative AI systems, such as chatbots, presents a paradox by including provisions that align with democratic values while strengthening government control. The proposal includes privacy requirements, transparency measures, and accountability mechanisms that protect individuals from AI harms. However, it also mandates content to reflect socialist values and bans content that subverts state power, giving regulators significant leverage. The regulation emphasizes protecting society from AI risks and shifts power to the government in defining AI rules. The draft highlights the importance of implementing strong institutions, oversight mechanisms, transparency measures, and inclusive public input to ensure AI serves democratic goals. It also underscores the need to address government use of AI and avoid a short-term race in developing unregulated AI systems.

### ***With AI emerging as both friend and foe, how should Malaysia regulate the technology?*** ###
<br/>
The increasing ubiquity of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in everyday life has prompted governments worldwide to grapple with the task of regulating this technology. With major powers like the United States and the European Union yet to establish comprehensive laws on AI, Malaysia is considering proactive steps to ensure the technology remains within the boundaries of safety, ethics, and fair competition. Experts suggest that while existing laws such as the Personal Data Protection Act provide a foundation for governing AI, a dedicated regulatory framework is needed. This framework should define different types of AI, set boundaries on its usage, establish a registry, conduct impact assessments, and involve key stakeholders like government agencies, industry players, and non-governmental organizations. Initiating discussions on AI regulation is crucial to prepare for an uncertain future.
