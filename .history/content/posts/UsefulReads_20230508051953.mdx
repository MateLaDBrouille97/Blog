The article explores a logical calculus of the ideas immanent in nervous activity. The authors argue that neural events and their relationships can be described using propositional logic due to the "all-or-none" character of nervous activity. They demonstrate that for any logical expression satisfying certain conditions, one can find a net behaving in the fashion it describes. The authors also show that many particular choices among possible neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, and discuss various applications of the calculus.

"Computing Machinery and Intelligence" by A. M. Turing is a seminal article in the history and philosophy of artificial intelligence. In it, Turing proposes the "Turing Test" as a way to determine whether a machine can exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to that of a human. The article discusses the meaning of terms like "machine" and "think," and argues against the idea that statistical surveys can answer the question of whether machines can think. The Turing Test has had a significant impact on AI research, and the debate over what constitutes "intelligence" in machines continues to this day.

Integrated electronics is the future of electronics itself. The advantages of integration will lead to a proliferation of electronics, pushing this science into many new areas. Integrated circuits will lead to wonders such as home computers, automatic controls for automobiles, and personal portable communications equipment. The biggest potential lies in the production of large systems, such as in telephone communications and data processing. The various technologies that make up integrated electronics were first investigated in the late 1950s with the goal of miniaturizing electronics equipment to include increasingly complex electronic functions in limited space with minimum weight.

The Lovelace 2.0 Test of Artificial Creativity and Intelligence is an alternative to the Turing Test for determining whether an agent is intelligent. It measures creativity and allows for a direct comparison of the relative intelligence of different agents. The test requires an artificial agent to create a wide range of types of creative artifacts, such as paintings, poetry, and stories, that meet requirements given by a human evaluator. The creation of certain types of artifacts, such as stories, require a wide repertoire of human-level intelligent capabilities. The ability to correctly respond to given constraints is a strong indicator of intelligence.
