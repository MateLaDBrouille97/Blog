"Generative AI at Work" is a study that explores the impact of a generative AI-based conversational assistant on worker productivity and organizational design. The study was conducted on a sample of 1,000 customer service agents across 10 call centers in the United States. The results show that access to the tool increases productivity by 14% on average, improves customer sentiment, reduces requests for managerial intervention, and improves employee retention. The AI model disseminates the knowledge of more able workers to newer workers, which helps to reduce knowledge gaps and improve overall performance.

The study also suggests that the use of generative AI-based conversational assistants can lead to a more decentralized decision-making process, where workers have more autonomy and are better able to solve problems on their own. The findings have important implications for the future of organizational design and worker productivity, as they suggest that the use of AI-based tools can lead to significant improvements in performance and job satisfaction. However, the study also highlights the need for careful consideration of the ethical implications of AI-based tools, particularly with regard to issues of privacy and data security.

# ***The clock is ticking for effective GPT data management***
<br/>
Judah Taub, the founder and managing partner of Hetz Ventures, warns that while Generative AI, powered by large language models like GPT, is garnering significant attention and investment, the focus on data management and infrastructure solutions is being overlooked. Data has become the new valuable resource for organizations, akin to oil, but its real value lies in the ability to utilize it effectively with AI and ML technologies. However, the increasing complexity of data management in modern organizations, driven by cloud environments, microservices, and APIs, demands proper attention and investment.
<br/>
Taub emphasizes that many people and the media are concentrating on the utilization of data and AI applications but are neglecting the overall management of data. Startups building on top of GPT or other AI applications receive more attention and investment compared to those working on data management solutions. However, efficient data management is crucial for AI systems, information security processes, and automated workflows. Without proper data management, these systems may face bottlenecks or even more serious issues.
<br/>
In response to this challenge, development units, particularly in Israel, are adapting to the importance of data management. There is a growing interest in data quality, process automation, analytics explainability, and cost optimization for modern data stacks. Entrepreneurs are increasingly recognizing the need to develop data and infrastructure solutions to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of applications like GPT.
<br/>
Taub concludes that effective data management is the key to better utilization of AI-based applications, and investing in this area will empower the next generation of AI startups and founders. By focusing on data management and infrastructure, the potential for generating value from data will significantly increase in the long term.

# ***The industrial economy goes digital: Transforming traditional industries***
<br/>
Tomer Landesman, an Associate at Pitango Growth, emphasizes the incredible paradigm shift happening as traditional industries transition into the digital age due to recent macro shifts and technological disruptions. He points out that while industrial industries have been essential for the economy for centuries, they have only recently experienced significant disruption from technology startups.
<br/>
One of the industries at the forefront of this shift is online retail, which saw rapid digitization during the pandemic, accelerating eCommerce adoption by a decade in just 90 days. The supply chain industry is also embracing technology due to natural disasters and geopolitical events. Labor shortages and generational turnover are pushing companies to explore new solutions, with automation, virtualization, and robotics becoming more prevalent.
<br/>
The emergence of Generations Y and Z in the workforce presents a massive opportunity for rapid technology adoption. Increasing competition and shrinking profit margins are motivating companies to seek digital solutions that can boost productivity and reduce costs.
<br/>
Government initiatives and policies, such as the U.S. government's Advanced Manufacturing Partnership and Biden's infrastructure bill, are further encouraging digitization in traditional industries to remain competitive.
<br/>
Landesman highlights the potential of Generative AI and the Omniverse to revolutionize factory simulations, optimize performance, and predict maintenance needs in real-time. He mentions several companies making strides in their respective industries, leveraging digitization and technology to solve pressing challenges.
<br/>
Overall, Landesman predicts significant technological advancements driven by digitization and automation in traditional industries over the next five years, with AI, automation, and computer vision playing crucial roles in this transformation.
