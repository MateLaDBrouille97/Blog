A new phishing attack campaign, known as MrTonyScam, has emerged on Facebook Messenger, orchestrated by a Vietnamese-based group. This attack employs a devious strategy, utilizing a swarm of fake and compromised personal accounts to disseminate messages containing malicious attachments. The attackers aim to take over victims' accounts ultimately.
<br/>
The attack involves sending enticing messages to potential victims, leading them to click on RAR and ZIP archive attachments. These attachments deploy a dropper, fetching the next stage from a GitHub or GitLab repository. This payload includes a CMD file housing an obfuscated Python-based stealer. This stealer is designed to extract cookies and login credentials from various web browsers, forwarding them to an actor-controlled Telegram or Discord API endpoint.
<br/>
A notable tactic is the deletion of stolen cookies, effectively logging victims out of their accounts. The scammers then seize control by using the stolen cookies to change passwords and hijack sessions.
<br/>
The campaign has achieved a surprisingly high success rate, infecting approximately 1 in 250 victims in the last 30 days. Most affected countries include the U.S., Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Indonesia, Japan, Nepal, Spain, the Philippines, and Vietnam.
<br/>
The attackers are linked to Vietnam based on language references in the Python stealer's source code and the inclusion of the Chromium-based browser, Cốc Cốc, popular in Vietnam.
<br/>
Guardio Labs warns that Facebook accounts with high reputations and followers can be monetized on dark markets, making them attractive targets for spreading scams and advertisements. This revelation coincides with recent reports of campaigns targeting Meta Business and Facebook accounts, indicating potential collaboration or shared resources among Vietnamese threat actors in the cybercriminal ecosystem focused on social media platforms.

# ***Charming Kitten's New Backdoor 'Sponsor' Targets Brazil, Israel, and U.A.E.***
<br/>
The Iranian cyber threat group known as Charming Kitten has recently launched a series of cyber espionage attacks in Brazil, Israel, and the U.A.E. These attacks involve the use of a previously unidentified backdoor called Sponsor. The campaign, called Sponsoring Access, primarily targets education, government, healthcare organizations, as well as human rights activists and journalists.
<br/>
Sponsor operates by deploying discreet configuration files stored on disk, making it challenging for scanning engines to detect. The attacks often begin by exploiting known vulnerabilities in internet-exposed Microsoft Exchange servers, echoing advisory warnings from Australia, the U.K., and the U.S. in November 2021.
<br/>
At least 34 victims have been identified so far, with the earliest instances dating back to September 2021. In one case, an Israeli insurance marketplace was infiltrated in August 2021, leading to the deployment of various malicious tools, including PowerLess, Plink, and a Go-based open-source post-exploitation toolkit named Merlin.
<br/>
The Merlin agent executed a Meterpreter reverse shell, which initiated communication with a new command-and-control server. On December 12th, 2021, a batch file named install.bat was executed, allowing Ballistic Bobcat operators to introduce their latest backdoor, Sponsor.
<br/>
Sponsor, written in C++, serves as a data-gathering tool, collecting host information and executing remote commands, file downloads, and updates to the list of attacker-controlled servers. Ballistic Bobcat maintains a scan-and-exploit approach, searching for unpatched vulnerabilities in internet-exposed Microsoft Exchange servers and employing a mix of open-source and custom applications in their attacks.
