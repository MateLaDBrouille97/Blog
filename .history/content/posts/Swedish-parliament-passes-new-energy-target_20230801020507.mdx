# ***Canada Turns to Nuclear Power After 30-Year Pause to Meet Demand Surge***
<br/>

<br />
Ontario is making strides in the adoption of nuclear energy as it announces two major projects aimed at expanding its nuclear power capacity. The province plans to enhance an existing plant, making it the largest nuclear facility globally, while also committing to the construction of three additional small modular reactors alongside an ongoing site development.
<br/>
This move signals a significant shift for the nuclear industry in Ontario, which has faced stagnation for several decades due to concerns about safety and cost overruns. The decision to invest in nuclear power is not only a means to modernize the aging power grid but also crucial for meeting the rising electricity demand without causing a sharp increase in electricity costs or compromising emissions reduction targets.
<br/>
The introduction of small modular reactors is a noteworthy development, as these reactors are more flexible, scalable, and cost-effective compared to traditional large-scale nuclear facilities. This initiative reflects Ontario's commitment to exploring innovative and sustainable energy solutions.
<br/>
By expanding its nuclear energy capacity, Ontario aims to double its grid capacity by 2050 and simultaneously decrease carbon emissions. This move is expected to play a crucial role in the province's efforts to achieve its environmental goals and transition towards a greener and more reliable energy future.

# ***Franceâ€™s nuclear power stations to limit energy output due to high river temperatures***
<br/>

<br/>
The early high-temperature warning in France is expected to result in reduced nuclear power production along the Rhone River. Two nuclear plants in eastern France are likely to face output restrictions due to the scorching weather forecasts. The Bugey plant's available power supply may be halved from July 13, and the Saint Alban plant's output could be affected from July 16. However, despite the restrictions, both plants will still produce a minimum of 1.8 GW and 1.3 GW, respectively, to meet grid requirements.
<br/>
Kpler analyst Emeric de Vigan believes that the impact on power prices would be minimal, as the restrictions are likely to occur during specific periods when solar output is at its peak. The current surplus power allows France to net export large amounts of electricity, mitigating the effects of these restrictions compared to the previous year.
<br/>
The data shows that the Garonne River in southern France, particularly the Golfech plant, has the highest potential for critical warming levels, but the plant is currently offline for maintenance.
<br/>
EDF, the nuclear operator, claims to be committed to adapting its facilities to climate change. While previous studies indicated no significant impact on biodiversity from higher temperatures, the French nuclear watchdog, ASN, observed a slight increase in algae and plankton growth around the Bugey plant during a previous heatwave, affecting fish populations at the Saint Alban plant. The watchdog continues to monitor the river biome for further ecological effects. Greenpeace campaigners urge authorities to adhere to existing water discharge regulations to minimize adverse effects on ecosystems.

# ***Why Are We So Afraid of Nuclear Power?***
<br/>

<br/>
The United States is on the cusp of a transformative shift toward decarbonizing the economy. Nuclear power, long misunderstood due to fear-based narratives and misinformation, holds significant potential to play a vital role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. When comparing carbon footprints, nuclear power emits fewer greenhouse gases per unit of electricity produced compared to wind and solar energy.
<br/>
Safety concerns also plague the perception of nuclear power. However, studies show that nuclear power has a lower fatality rate than natural gas and coal power. While accidents like Three Mile Island did have consequences, nuclear energy's overall safety track record has been relatively sound.
<br/>
The public's perception of nuclear power is often influenced by media coverage and risk perception rather than statistical evidence. Anti-nuclear activism, sparked by fears of nuclear weapons, contributed to a decline in the power sector in the past, leading to the cancellation of proposed nuclear reactors.
<br/>
Despite the downsides of uranium mining and the challenges of storing spent fuel, nuclear power remains a viable option in the fight against climate change. A clear-headed assessment of costs and benefits, devoid of fear and bias, could reveal that nuclear energy, along with renewables, is an essential tool to combat climate change. With the pressing urgency of climate issues, it is crucial to reevaluate the role of nuclear power in the energy transition and consider its potential benefits.
