The infographic explores the impact of AI and the metaverse on the datasphereâ€”the infrastructure that stores and processes data. The rise of large language models (LLMs) in the field of AI has significantly increased the computational resources needed to train and operate them. LLMs have evolved over the years, with OpenAI's GPT-4 requiring a training compute 55 thousand times greater than its predecessor in 2023. This exponential growth in AI systems will demand exponentially larger computers in the future.
<br/>
The metaverse, an immersive web accessed through AR and VR, will further increase demands on the datasphere. Applications like AR, VR, and holograms that are integral to the metaverse require high bitrate and low latency. This means more data needs to be moved quickly, adding to the challenges faced by the datasphere.
<br/>
Data centers play a critical role in storing and processing the data we produce and running the applications we rely on. They are evolving to meet the growing demands placed on them. Data centers have taken two broad approaches: going big with large hyperscale data centers and going small with edge computing to improve latency.
<br/>
Investment in data centers is expected to increase, with global spending on edge data centers projected to reach $208 billion in 2023. As the amount of data produced annually is expected to grow to 221 zettabytes by 2026, data centers will have a critical role to play in managing the datasphere.

# ***Charted: The Exponential Growth in AI Computation***

The exponential growth in AI computation has been a key factor in the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence. This growth can be observed through the amount of computation power used to train AI models. The history of AI computation can be divided into three eras: the pre-deep learning era, the deep learning era, and the era of large-scale AI models.
<br />
In the pre-deep learning era, computation power grew according to Moore's Law, which states that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles approximately every two years. This era lasted from the 1950s to 2010, with compute doubling every 18-24 months.
<br />
The deep learning era, which began in 2010 with the emergence of AlexNet, saw a significant decrease in the doubling timeframe of compute. It now doubled every 5-7 months as researchers invested more in computation and processors.
<br />
The third era, identified with the emergence of AlphaGo in 2015, is characterized by the use of large-scale AI models that require even more computation power. Compute is now doubling every 11 months in this era.
<br />
The growth in compute can be illustrated by looking at the amount of computation power used to train different AI models throughout history. For example, the compute used to train Minerva, an AI that can solve complex math problems, is nearly 6 million times that used to train AlexNet 10 years ago.
<br />
The availability of massive data sets and better algorithms, coupled with the growth in computation power, has led to significant progress in AI in a relatively short period of time. AI models now not only match but also beat human performance in many areas.
<br />
However, sustaining this pace of computation growth may prove challenging. Large-scale models require increasingly more compute power to train, and the exhaustion of available training data could impede the development of new models. Nonetheless, with the current level of funding and research in AI, more breakthroughs may be on the horizon.
