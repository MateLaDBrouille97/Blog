The European Union (EU) has signaled its intention to develop its own approach regarding investment in China's advanced technology sector, instead of immediately adopting the outright bans on investment in China's technology sector as done by the US. The EU plans to propose its approach by the end of the year, focusing on limiting potential security risks associated with outbound investments. While the White House issued an executive order limiting US investment in sectors posing "significant national security risks," the European Commission stated that it was in close contact with the US but would not immediately follow suit.
<br/>
The EU's approach is influenced by its economic ties with China, which are more intertwined than those of the US. European countries like Germany and France are cautious about the impact of investment bans on their economies and financial markets. The EU aims to prevent the misuse of core technological advances that could enhance military and intelligence capabilities and undermine international peace and security. However, it favors a policy of "de-risking" instead of outright bans.
<br/>
Countries like Germany and France have been navigating a balance between economic ties with China and concerns over critical technologies. The EU's trade chief, Valdis Dombrovskis, highlighted the need to monitor investments while maintaining good relations with Beijing. The EU's foreign direct investment in China over the past two decades has surpassed €140 billion. The EU's approach underscores its focus on security concerns while being mindful of economic implications.

# ***Biden Orders Ban on New Investments in China’s Sensitive High-Tech Industries***
<br/>
President Biden has signed an executive order banning new American investments in key technology sectors with potential military applications in China. The move is part of an effort to prevent American funds from supporting Beijing's military modernization efforts. The order specifically targets venture capital and private equity firms, prohibiting them from investing in Chinese initiatives related to semiconductors, microelectronics, quantum computers, and specific artificial intelligence applications. While the administration emphasizes the national security aspect of the order, China views it as part of a broader campaign to curb its rise. 
<br/>
This move comes amid increasing tensions between the two largest economies and builds upon existing export controls and restrictions. The U.S. government has grown concerned that investments in technology and joint ventures were indirectly fueling China's military capabilities. Critics of the order argue it's too narrow and late to have a substantial impact, while others believe it could have chilling effects on broader investment beyond the targeted industries. 
<br/>
China has expressed disappointment and stated that the order will harm business cooperation and international confidence in the U.S. business environment. This order coincides with a bipartisan effort in Congress to impose similar limits. The U.S. is also working to rally allies, including Britain and the European Union, to take similar steps, indicating that the strategy is part of a broader approach to pressure China.

China has strongly criticized the US government's decision to impose a ban on new American investments in key technology sectors within China. The move, seen as part of the US's ongoing efforts to curb China's technological advancement, has led China to lodge protests and pledge countermeasures to protect its interests. While the US cites national security concerns as the reason behind the executive order, Chinese officials argue that this constitutes "economic coercion" and a breach of market principles. Despite potential claims of a chilling effect, Chinese experts and insiders dismiss the ban's impact, as previous crackdowns have already led to decreased US investments in the Chinese tech industry. Analysts argue that this latest US move highlights its desperation to contain China and challenges its credibility.
<br/>
The executive order, signed by President Joe Biden, bans US investments in areas like semiconductors, microelectronics, quantum computers, and certain AI applications, with the US Treasury Department asserting it is necessary to safeguard national security. Chinese authorities argue that this is an overreach and an attempt to undermine China's development, calling it economic coercion and tech bullying. They urge the US to honor commitments to cooperation and remove investment restrictions. Chinese tech industry insiders believe that the impact might not be severe, given the decline in US investment due to earlier measures. They emphasize that funds seeking profit will continue to find ways despite the ban's constraints. The move adds complexity to the already strained China-US relations, potentially affecting dialogues between officials.
<br/>
In conclusion, China's strong condemnation of the US investment ban underscores the ongoing tensions in their relationship and the broader technological competition between the two nations.
