China's National Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund (also known as the Big Fund) is investing an additional $1.9 billion in Yangtze Memory Technologies Co. (YMTC), the country's largest memory chip producer.
The investment is aimed at boosting China's domestic semiconductor industry and reducing its reliance on other countries, especially as US sanctions are limiting China's access to manufacturing capabilities.
Chinese President Xi Jinping has urged the country to hasten scientific research to become self-sufficient in vital technologies, emphasizing the need to strengthen basic research, improve overall coordination, increase policy support, and promote high-quality development of research.
The US is seeking to prevent Western technology from being used to modernize the Chinese military, and has recently added 37 entities to a trade blocklist, including units of Chinese cloud computing company Inspur, for "contributing to Russia's military and/or defense industrial base, supporting PRC military modernization, and facilitating or engaging in human rights abuses."
In early October, the US issued export controls restricting US firms from selling advanced semiconductors and equipment required to make them to some Chinese manufacturers, and in mid-December, the restrictions were expanded to include 36 more Chinese chipmakers, including YMTC.
