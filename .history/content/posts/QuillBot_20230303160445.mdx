# What is Grammarly ?
<br/>

QuillBot is a paraphrasing tool that uses AI technology to rephrase text while keeping the meaning intact. 
<br/>
Founded by three computer science students in 2017, QuillBot has been continuously expanding its features to provide additional value to its users.
 Along with the paraphrasing tool, QuillBot also has a summarizing tool, grammar checker, and citation generator.
  QuillBot is user-friendly and offers both automated and manual paraphrasing options. 
  The tool includes six different paraphrasing modes and has several useful features like word protection and comparison modes.
   QuillBot provides a Chrome extension and integration with Google Docs and Microsoft Word. The QuillBot paraphraser has premium 
   accounts with additional features like Creative Plus, Shorten, Expand, and Formal modes. 
   The premium membership allows access to faster processing, comparison mode, longest unchanged words, and freeze words features.
    While QuillBot is a good investment for those who don't need sophisticated paraphrasing tools that can create original content free of plagiarism, 
    it does have some limitations, such as a modest paraphraser character limit and no uniqueness indicator to check plagiarism.
