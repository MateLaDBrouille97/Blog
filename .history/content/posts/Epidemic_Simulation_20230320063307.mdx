# Boids
<br />
Boids are artificial life objects that were developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986. These objects mimic the behavior of bird flocks or fish schools. The three basic steering mechanics of Boids are:
<br />
1-Separation: Boids try to avoid colliding with each other by maintaining a safe distance. They accomplish this by steering away from nearby Boids.
<br />
2-Alignment: Boids try to align their velocity and direction of motion with nearby Boids. This helps them to move in a cohesive manner and avoid collisions.
<br />
3-Cohesion: Boids try to stay close to nearby Boids to move together in a group. This helps them to simulate the behavior of bird flocks or fish schools, where individual birds or fish move together as a cohesive unit.
<br />

```java
public Boid() {
        if(!hasInfected) {
            healthStatus = INFECTED;
            hasInfected = true;
            hasDisease = true;
            lifeSpan = 2000;
        }
        this.position = new Vector((double)(Math.random()*BoidRunner.WIDTH),(double)(Math.random()*BoidRunner.HEIGHT));
        double angle = Math.random()*360;
        double radius = Math.random()*2+2; //2-4
        this.velocity = new Vector((radius * Math.cos(angle)), (radius * Math.sin(angle)));
        this.acceleration = new Vector(0,0);
        if((int)(Math.random()*500)==0 && !hasDisease) {
            this.isParamedic = true;
            this.healthStatus = PARAMEDIC;
            immunity = 2000;
        }
    }
```
<br />
The code you have provided appears to be written in Java and represents a constructor for a class called "Boid". The constructor initializes various properties of an instance of the "Boid" class.
The constructor begins by checking whether the "hasInfected" property is false. If it is, then the "healthStatus" property is set to "INFECTED", "hasInfected" is set to true, "hasDisease" is set to true, and "lifeSpan" is set to 2000.
Next, the constructor initializes the "position" property to a randomly generated "Vector" object, with the x and y coordinates being within the bounds of the "BoidRunner" width and height. The "velocity" property is also initialized to a "Vector" object, with the magnitude being between 2 and 4 and the angle being a random value between 0 and 360 degrees.
If a random number between 0 and 499 (inclusive) is equal to 0 and the "hasDisease" property is false, then the "isParamedic" property is set to true, the "healthStatus" property is set to "PARAMEDIC", and the "immunity" property is set to 2000.

This is a Java code for simulating the behavior of a flock of birds, specifically for simulating the spread of a disease. The flock is represented as an ArrayList of Boid objects, and each Boid has properties such as position, velocity, immunity, and health status.
The code begins with a method called "Vector align(ArrayList **Boid** flock)," which calculates the alignment of each Boid in the flock by summing up the velocities of nearby Boids within a certain perception radius. If a Boid has a disease, the code reduces its lifespan and determines whether it should die or recover based on a mortality rate. If a Boid is immune, the code reduces its immunity lifespan and determines whether it should lose its immunity.
If a Boid is not a paramedic or a paramedic not locked onto a patient, the code checks the nearby Boids and adds their velocities to the steering vector if they are within the perception radius. The code also simulates viral transmission, immunity gain, immunity loss, and paramedic curing. Finally, the code updates the Boid's position and velocity based on its steering vector and other factors.
There are some sound effects that are played during certain events, such as when a Boid recovers or is diagnosed with a disease. There is also a siren sound effect that is played when a paramedic is locked onto a patient.
Overall, this code is a simulation of a flock of birds with disease spread and immunity gain/loss dynamics. The code also has some elements of a game, with sound effects and a paramedic feature.

```java
Vector cohesion(ArrayList<Boid> flock) {
        int perceptionRadius = (int)(cohesionPerceptionRadius);
        int total = 0;
        Vector steering = new Vector(0,0);
        if(!this.isParamedic || (this.isParamedic && !lockedOn))
            for(Boid boid : flock) {
                double dist = distance(this.position.xvalue, this.position.yvalue, boid.position.xvalue, boid.position.yvalue);
                if(boid != this && dist < perceptionRadius) {
                    steering.add(boid.position);
                    total++;
                }
            }
        if((total > 0 || (this.isParamedic && lockedOn && patient.velocity.movement() != 0))) {
            if(total > 0)
                steering.divide((double)total);
            else {
                patientDistance = distance(this.position.xvalue, this.position.yvalue, patient.position.xvalue, patient.position.yvalue);
                steering.add(patient.position);
            }
            steering.subtract(this.position);
            steering.setMagnitude(maxSpeed);
            steering.subtract(this.velocity);
            steering.limit(maxForce*((this.isParamedic && lockedOn)?3:1));
        }
        return steering;

The code provided is written in Java and contains a method called "Vector cohesion" which takes an ArrayList of Boid objects called "flock" as its parameter. The method calculates the cohesion force for a given Boid object based on the positions of nearby Boid objects within a certain radius (determined by the cohesionPerceptionRadius variable).
The method initializes variables for the perception radius, the total number of nearby Boids, and the steering force. It then loops through each Boid in the flock and calculates the distance between the current Boid and the other Boids. If the distance is within the perception radius and the other Boid is not itself, then the other Boid's position is added to the steering force and the total number of nearby Boids is incremented.
If the current Boid is not a paramedic or if it is a paramedic but not currently locked onto a patient, then the method proceeds to calculate the steering force based on the nearby Boids. If there are nearby Boids, then the steering force is divided by the total number of nearby Boids to calculate the average position. If there are no nearby Boids, then the steering force is directed towards the patient's position. In either case, the steering force is then adjusted to take into account the current Boid's position and velocity, and is limited by a maximum force determined by the maxForce and isParamedic variables.
Finally, the method returns the steering force as a Vector object.

The code is implementing the behavior of a flock of birds or boids. The flock consists of objects called boids which have certain attributes such as position, velocity, and health status.
The functions cohesion, alignment, and separation are used to calculate the three basic behaviors of the flock - cohesion (keeping the flock together), alignment (aligning the boids' velocities), and separation (preventing collisions between boids).
The flock function calculates the acceleration of each boid by calling the cohesion, alignment, and separation functions and adding their results.
The separation function calculates the separation vector for each boid, which is the sum of the differences between the position of the boid and its neighbors, scaled by the inverse square of the distance between them. If a boid is too close to another boid or if the other boid is dead or a paramedic, the separation vector is multiplied by a factor to increase the separation force.
The cohesion function calculates the cohesion vector for each boid, which is the average position of its neighbors within a certain radius. The alignment function calculates the average velocity vector of its neighbors within a certain radius.
Overall, these functions work together to simulate the flocking behavior of birds, and can be modified to simulate other group behaviors such as fish schooling or swarm robotics.

The update() method is responsible for updating the position, velocity, and acceleration of each Boid object.
First, it checks if the Boid is dead. If not, and the Boid is a paramedic and is locked onto a patient (meaning it is currently treating the patient), the Boid will move towards the patient's position at an increased speed. If the Boid is not a paramedic or is not locked onto a patient, it simply moves in its current direction and speed.
Next, the velocity of the Boid is updated based on the acceleration. The velocity is then limited to the maxSpeed.
If the Boid is dead and its deathAngle has not been set yet, the deathAngle is set to the velocity direction plus pi/2 radians.
If the Boid is currently the patient that a paramedic is locked onto, its healthStatus color is updated to alternate between two colors.
Finally, if the Boid is a paramedic and is locked onto a dead patient, it resets the Boid properties related to treating a patient, such as setting the patient to null and the travelTime to 0.

void edges() {
        if(this.position.xvalue > BoidRunner.WIDTH)
            this.position.xvalue = 0;
        else if(this.position.xvalue < 0)
            this.position.xvalue = BoidRunner.WIDTH;
        
        if(this.position.yvalue > BoidRunner.HEIGHT)
            this.position.yvalue = 0;
        else if(this.position.yvalue < 0)
            this.position.yvalue = BoidRunner.HEIGHT;
    }

    double distance(double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2) {
        return Math.sqrt(Math.pow((x2-x1), 2) + Math.pow((y2-y1), 2));
    }

    public void draw(Graphics2D g) {
        AffineTransform save = g.getTransform();
        g.translate((int)this.position.xvalue, (int)this.position.yvalue);
        if(!this.dead)
            g.rotate(this.velocity.dir() + Math.PI/2);
        else
            g.rotate(deathAngle);
        g.setColor(healthStatus);
        g.fill(shape);
        g.draw(shape);
        g.setTransform(save);
    }

The first method, "edges()", ensures that the boid stays within the bounds of the window. If the boid goes off the right edge of the screen, it wraps around to the left edge. If it goes off the left edge, it wraps around to the right edge. Similarly, if the boid goes off the bottom edge of the screen, it wraps around to the top edge. If it goes off the top edge, it wraps around to the bottom edge.
The second method, "distance()", calculates the distance between two points in 2D space using the Pythagorean theorem.
The third method, "draw()", takes a Graphics2D object and uses it to draw the boid on the screen. It first saves the current state of the Graphics2D object, then translates it to the boid's position, rotates it to face the direction of the boid's velocity, and sets the color to the boid's health status. It then fills and draws the boid's shape, and restores the Graphics2D object to its original state. If the boid is dead, it rotates it to the angle of its death.
