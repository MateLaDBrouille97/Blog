In its second round of proposals, the Italian central bank's Milano Hub has chosen a project led by Cetif Advisory and Polygon Labs. The project aims to research a security token ecosystem for institutional decentralized finance (DeFi) and does not have a commercialization purpose. It aims to extend the analysis of security tokens on secondary markets, which are digital representations of real-world asset ownership.
<br/>
Cetif Advisory's general manager, Imanuel Baharier, emphasized the importance of creating a safe and open operating environment for supervised entities in the DeFi space. The project's goal is to enable institutional market participants to operate in DeFi while complying with regulatory guidelines. It will also enhance Cetif Advisory's Lionity platform, described as an "institutional grade automated market maker."
<br/>
The project, supported by Milano Hub for six months, involves collaboration with Polygon Labs, Fireblocks, and other organizations. Several Italian banks, asset management companies, and ten other financial institutions will participate.
<br/>
The emergence of security tokenization in blockchain technology has gained attention, with the potential for the tokenized securities market to reach a value between $4 trillion and $5 trillion by 2030, with private equity and venture capital being the most tokenized sectors, followed by real estate.

# ***How blockchain is transforming fundraising for startups and entrepreneurs***

<br />
The emergence of blockchain technology has the potential to disrupt the traditional venture capital world and bring about a revolution in the way startups are funded and invested in. One significant aspect of this disruption is the tokenization of assets, enabled by blockchain, which allows for fractional ownership and liquidity of traditionally illiquid assets like real estate and early-stage startups. This expands investment opportunities and allows a wider range of investors to participate in ventures by owning digital tokens.
<br/>
Another key aspect is the use of smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with predefined rules encoded on the blockchain. These contracts can eliminate the need for intermediaries, reducing costs and increasing efficiency in the investment process, thereby fostering trust between investors and entrepreneurs.
<br/>
By eliminating intermediaries, blockchain democratizes access to funding, empowering entrepreneurs globally and attracting investment from a wider pool of investors. It transcends geographical boundaries, connecting investors and entrepreneurs worldwide, offering greater opportunities for startups and investors in emerging markets where traditional venture capital may be limited.
<br/>
Furthermore, blockchain-based platforms facilitate the creation of secondary markets, allowing investors to trade their tokens representing ownership in ventures. This provides liquidity to early-stage investors, enhancing the overall attractiveness of venture capital investments.
<br/>
Decentralized fundraising platforms based on blockchain technology offer a sense of community and direct interaction between project owners and backers. They often integrate governance structures and voting mechanisms, empowering tokenholders to participate in decision-making processes, aligning stakeholder interests, and fostering project success.
<br/>
Democratizing fundraising in the Web3 sector promotes inclusion and access, breaking down barriers to financial support, fostering diversity and innovation, and empowering entrepreneurs to engage with a global network of supporters who align with their goals and values.
<br/>
Overall, the integration of blockchain technology in venture capital is reshaping the investment landscape and creating a more open, accessible, and collaborative ecosystem for funding startups and ventures.

# ***South Korea to pilot CBDC in one of these three cities, not Seoul***
<br/>
The Bank of Korea has identified three regions, namely Jeju, Busan, and Incheon, for testing its central bank digital currency (CBDC) in a "private target CBDC test bed." The bank intends to experiment with payments and distribution at a public level while also securing franchises that can accept CBDC payments. The CBDC electronic wallet app will be accessible not only to local residents but also to tourists. The regional closed tests of the CBDC will follow a similar issuance and distribution process as the current local currency scheme implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic. Jeju, Busan, and Incheon issue and distribute their own local currencies, making them suitable candidates for the CBDC pilot. Jeju, with the second-largest population and fewer technical barriers, is favored as a test bed due to Busan's larger number of eligible citizens. Additionally, some commercial banks in South Korea are researching stablecoins as alternatives to CBDCs to enhance efficiency.
