Yangtze Memory Technologies Co. (YMTC), the country's largest producer of memory chips, will receive an additional $1.9 billion investment from China's National Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund (BIG Fund).
This investment is intended to strengthen the Chinese semiconductor industry and reduce its reliance on other countries, especially in light of the US sanctions that limit the country's ability to access manufacturing facilities.
In order to become self-sufficient in vital technologies, China's president has urged the country to accelerate scientific research, emphasizing the need for strengthening basic research, improving overall coordination, enhancing policy support, and encouraging high-quality research development.
The US is seeking to prevent Western technology from being used to modernize the Chinese military, and has recently added 37 entities to a trade blocklist, including units of Chinese cloud computing company Inspur, for "contributing to Russia's military and/or defense industrial base, supporting PRC military modernization, and facilitating or engaging in human rights abuses."
Early October, the US restricted US companies from selling advanced semiconductors and equipment needed to make them to some Chinese chipmakers, and in mid-December, the restrictions were expanded to include 36 more Chinese chipmakers, including YMTC.
