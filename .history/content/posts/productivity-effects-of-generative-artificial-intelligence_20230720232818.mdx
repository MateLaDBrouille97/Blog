An experiment conducted by Noy and Zhang examined the impact of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology, specifically the assistive chatbot ChatGPT, on mid-level professional writing tasks. The experiment involved 453 college-educated professionals who were randomly assigned to use ChatGPT for their writing tasks. The results revealed that ChatGPT significantly increased productivity, reducing the average time taken by 40% and improving output quality by 18%.
<br/>
Interestingly, participants with weaker skills benefited the most from using ChatGPT, leading to potential policy implications for reducing productivity inequality through AI. The experiment also showed that workers exposed to ChatGPT during the experiment were more likely to continue using it in their real jobs even after the experiment had ended.

The emergence of powerful generative AI technologies like ChatGPT raises important questions about their impact on the labor market. Such AI systems can either displace human workers entirely from certain occupations or augment existing human workers by increasing their productivity. For example, ChatGPT could either replace certain types of writers or enhance the productivity of grant writers and marketers by automating routine tasks.

The study demonstrated the potential of generative AI to complement human skills and enhance productivity in professional writing tasks. However, further research is needed to explore the broader effects of such technologies on the labor market and the implications for different worker skill levels.

### ***Franco-British standoff to take the lead in the AI ​​of a delayed Europe***
<br/>

France and the United Kingdom are both investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI) to compete with American tech giants and potentially China. French President Emmanuel Macron pledged 500 million euros in new funding for AI startups, adding to the government's previous commitment of 1.5 billion euros. He aims to make France a leading player in AI in continental Europe. Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced a one billion pound investment in research on supercomputers and AI, with 900 million pounds dedicated to a project dubbed "BritGPT," referencing OpenAI's generative AI.
<br/>
However, there's a significant difference between the two nations. France is subject to EU regulations on AI, which include assessing risks to European citizens' freedoms, such as biometric surveillance and social rating systems. On the other hand, the UK, having left the EU, takes a "soft" approach to regulation, preferring government advice for AI companies.
<br/>
The move by both countries reflects a broader trend of countries seeking to capitalize on AI's commercial potential. Until now, the AI race was largely dominated by American tech firms, but Europe is now actively trying to catch up. However, Europe's regulatory landscape poses challenges for France, while the UK seeks a more flexible approach.

### ***Apple is about to join the AI ​​race, with "Apple GPT"***
<br/>
Apple is secretly developing its own artificial intelligence (AI) tools, including a competitor to OpenAI's ChatGPT. The company aims to challenge Google and OpenAI in the AI space by building its own language models and a chatbot service called "Apple GPT." Apple has been integrating AI into its ecosystem for some time but fell behind with the rapid rise of ChatGPT. While CEO Tim Cook has expressed reservations about AI in the past, Apple is now eager to catch up with the AI-driven market. The news of Apple's AI ambitions was well-received by investors, leading to a rise in shares.
