<br />
The EU is determined to diversify its supply chains and promote environmental sustainability in procurement bids. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has called for the EU to "de-risk" its exposure to China, signaling a shift in trade dynamics between the two economic giants. However, the proposed changes to the public procurement rule book have raised concerns about potential violations of international laws, including World Trade Organization (WTO) obligations and government procurement agreement obligations, and being seen as green protectionism.
<br />
The draft Net Zero Industry Act places a strong emphasis on the importance of diversified supply chains and increased sustainability. The goal is to boost EU production of green technologies to 40% by 2030 through interventions in the market. The European Commission is also planning to support the development of carbon capture technology by requiring large oil and gas extractors to commit to storing up to 50 million tonnes of CO2 annually by 2030, with individual targets assigned to each company. Additionally, a separate proposal aims to promote domestic mining of critical raw materials, such as lithium, which are essential for green technology.
<br />
However, the legislative process for these proposed measures may take up to two years before they become law, as they need to be approved by the European Parliament and member states. China has already requested that European countries implementing significant environmental trade measures submit a written report to the WTO to discuss their legal basis, impact on trade, consistency with international rules, and potential effects on developing countries.
<br />
The EU's decision to curb imports of Chinese green technology is part of a broader reevaluation of trade dynamics between the EU and China. The EU is seeking new ways to monitor European companies' investments in overseas production facilities to limit China's ability to acquire advanced technologies from the West. With China's increasing dominance in green technology, with over 90% of some solar panel components being manufactured in China, European policymakers are raising concerns about Europe's reliance on Chinese green tech and the need to reduce dependence on Russian gas as well.
<br />
The proposed measures aim to promote the EU green tech industry, particularly in sectors where it remains competitive, such as wind turbines and heat pumps. The draft of the Net Zero Industry Act highlights that the EU's trade balance in these sectors is deteriorating due to rising energy and input costs for European manufacturers. Brussels is hopeful that by implementing these new policies, it can reverse this trend and support the growth of the European green tech industry.
