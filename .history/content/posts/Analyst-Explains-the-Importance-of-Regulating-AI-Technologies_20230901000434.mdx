Author Tom Kemp argues that once technology is unleashed, it's irreversible, advocating for regulations rather than trying to undo progress. His book "Containing Big Tech: How to Protect Our Civil Rights, Economy, and Democracy" explores these regulations and their impact on society. The growing AI sector has shifted from rapid development to disruptive influences, including malicious uses like spam campaigns and deepfake creation. Balancing AI's benefits with potential harm is crucial, akin to Pandora's box. Dr. Timnit Gebru of the Distributed Artificial Intelligence Research Institute emphasizes addressing AI bias requires comprehensive principles, standards, and regulatory bodies, similar to the FDA's role. She notes solving this goes beyond diverse datasets, requiring systemic change to prevent political misuse and deception, particularly vital given the upcoming US presidential election. The Federal Election Commission is evaluating AI's potential control over political ad appearance alteration. Generative AI's rise has led to a surge in realistic fake images, contributing to deepfake concerns.

# ***FEC Evaluates Regulation of AI-Powered Political Ads Amid Deepfake Concerns***

<br />
The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is considering regulating the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in political campaigns, specifically focusing on AI-generated content that distorts the image of opposing candidates. The concern has escalated as the 2024 US presidential election approaches, with the increasing utilization of generative AI leading to the creation of convincing fake images and deepfakes that can deceive voters. This technology could be exploited to attribute false statements or actions to rivals, manipulating public opinion. The FEC's unanimous procedural vote has moved forward a petition to regulate ads that use AI to depict opponents engaging in fabricated actions or statements. Notably, this issue has gained attention within the ongoing 2024 GOP presidential primary.
<br/>
The FEC's authority in overseeing deepfake advertisements remains uncertain due to potential conflicts with First Amendment protections. Advocacy group Public Citizen has queried the applicability of federal laws against "fraudulent misrepresentation" to deepfakes, prompting the FEC to examine the matter. The FEC's jurisdiction is limited concerning ads from political action committees (PACs) and individual social media users. As generative AI becomes more affordable and widespread, the sharing of deepfake content is likely to increase. Republican Commissioner Allen Dickerson expressed skepticism about the FEC's jurisdiction over regulating deepfakes during a recent meeting, emphasizing that such authority would imply penalizing manipulated media in campaign ads.

# ***International Monetary Fund Reveals How Generative AI Can Affect the Financial Sector***
<br/>

<br />
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has issued a detailed report examining the potential effects of integrating generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems within the financial domain. This study acknowledges the benefits of generative AI, such as improved efficiency and customer experience in financial services, while cautioning against the associated risks. Generative AI, exemplified by systems like ChatGPT that produce various types of content, holds promise for tasks such as automated document processing, analytics, customer support chatbots, and product development in the financial sector.
<br/>
However, the report highlights several considerable concerns encompassing data privacy, bias, accuracy, cybersecurity, and financial stability. It points out that while generative AI can enhance predictive models for threat detection and incident response, its widespread adoption could also lead to systemic risks. These include potential overreliance on AI-generated reports during market fluctuations, rapid dissemination of inaccurate information, and the exacerbation of market manipulations driven by AI.
<br/>
To address these challenges, the IMF provides recommendations for financial institutions, including comprehensive pilot testing and risk assessment prior to deploying generative AI systems, maintaining human oversight and accountability in AI-informed decisions, adhering to regulatory guidance, and limiting the deployment of generative AI in non-sensitive areas until risks are better understood. The report anticipates evolving regulatory standards to govern generative AI's use and encourages regulators to bolster oversight capacities while fostering prudent industry adoption.
<br/>
In conclusion, the IMF's report underscores the potential advantages and pitfalls of integrating generative AI into finance. It underscores the necessity for a cautious and regulated approach to ensure that the technology's benefits are harnessed while mitigating its potential negative consequences. Collaboration between financial institutions and regulatory bodies is recommended to strike a balance between innovation and industry stability.
