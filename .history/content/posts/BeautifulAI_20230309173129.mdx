# What is Beautiful.AI ?
<br/>

Attention all presenters, whether you're a pro, part of a team, or an enterprise looking to spice up your slides, have no fear because Beautiful.ai is here! This presentation app is your knight in shining armor, using artificial intelligence to make your slide decks quick, easy, and oh so beautiful.
But let's cut to the chase, we know you're all here for the goods. Beautiful.ai offers three plans, the Pro plan for a measly $12 a month with an annual subscription, the Team plan at $40 per user per month (billed annually, but hey you can pay monthly if you're feeling fancy), and last but not least, the Enterprise plan. 
The Enterprise plan is so custom, it's like a bespoke suit for your company's needs.
Beautiful.ai has got your back with a wide variety of pre-designed layouts that'll make you look like a pro in no time. 
They've got everything from blank presentations to team templates, and starter templates to get your creative juices flowing. And when it comes to slide creation, Beautiful.ai doesn't disappoint. 
You can adjust color schemes, switch or edit themes, and add some pizzazz with animation options.
But wait, there's more! Beautiful.ai even lets you add audio to your presentation. You can record directly into the app, or if you're feeling fancy (and have a better microphone than your laptop), you can import an audio file. 
And if you're struggling with the layout, Beautiful.ai's got your back with their Smart Slide layouts. They're broken up into categories like Structural, Essential, Data, Timelines, and Impact.
But the fun doesn't stop there, my fellow presenters. 
Beautiful.ai lets you preview your slide decks with the Present button in the top toolbar. 
And if you're feeling brave enough to share your masterpiece with the world, just hit the Share button on the left toolbar.
So what are you waiting for? Say goodbye to those boring, uninspired slides and hello to Beautiful.ai. Your audience will thank you (and so will your boss).
