The report emphasizes the need for TA to be anticipatory, align with key goals, involve diverse stakeholders, and produce usable intelligence on the ethical, legal, environmental, and societal implications of deploying new technologies. It also stresses the importance of clear messaging and timely intelligence that informs policy at the right time with a clear connection to the decision-making process.
<br />
One crucial aspect of designing effective TA processes is making clear the framing and biases inherent to the exercise. For example, when assessing the risks associated with hydraulic fracturing for shale gas, different lenses of evaluation play a key role in shaping the evidence and insights produced by the TA. By acknowledging and addressing these biases, policymakers and stakeholders can position the evidence in a way that best informs decision-making.
<br />
Coordination and collaboration with different communities that are developing strategic intelligence on new and emerging technologies are also crucial to TA's effectiveness. The report suggests that building international capacity by facilitating coordination and collaboration with other communities might be a productive avenue to pursue.
<br />
The report provides policymakers and stakeholders with a framework for designing and implementing robust technology assessments that align with current trends in governance and science, technology, and innovation policy. Effective TA must be anticipatory, involve diverse stakeholders, and produce usable intelligence on the ethical, legal, environmental, and societal implications of deploying new technologies. By making clear the framing and biases inherent to TA exercises and collaborating with different communities, policymakers can position the evidence and insights produced by TA in a way that best informs decision-making.
