In a research paper titled "Are Ideas Getting Harder to Find," the authors analyze the amount of research and development (R&D) resources required to achieve technological advancement in various domains. They observe that while growth has been steady in these domains, the number of human minds required to achieve that growth has multiplied over the past few decades. This implies that it is becoming more challenging to generate new ideas and innovations.

The authors examine the case of Moore's Law, which shows that the rate of progress has been steady at 35% per year, but the effective number of researchers has grown almost 20-fold since 1971. In agriculture, the increase in annual yields across major crops has been consistent for half a century, but the gains are costing more and more. Similarly, the progress in machine learning has not yielded any visible increase in the growth rate of progress, despite increased research efforts.

The authors also analyze the number of patents issued as a measure of innovation. They find that more R&D effort has been roughly matched by more patenting. However, in recent years, patenting has increased faster than R&D effort, indicating that innovation is becoming more difficult.

Finally, the authors consider total factor productivity (TFP), a measure of progress that can be computed for entire industries or economies. They find that TFP has shown a decline in productivity over the years, suggesting that it is becoming more challenging to generate new ideas and innovations.

In summary, the authors' research suggests that generating new ideas and innovations is becoming increasingly difficult, as more R&D effort is required to achieve technological advancement across various domains. This has important implications for future economic growth and the sustainability of our current technological trajectory.
