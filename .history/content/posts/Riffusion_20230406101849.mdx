# What is Riffusion?
<br/>
Have you ever wondered how artificial intelligence can be used to create music? Riffusion, an innovative AI music-making project, is here to show you just that.
<br/>
So how does it work? Instead of using audio, Riffusion uses visual representations of audio called spectrograms. These spectrograms show the amplitude of different frequencies over time and are the key to Riffusion's unique approach. Forsgren and Martiros fine-tuned a machine learning technique called Stable Diffusion on spectrograms of various types of music. They then fed these spectrograms into the model and taught it to match prompts like "funky piano" or "jazzy saxophone."
<br/>
The results are nothing short of amazing. Riffusion can produce spectrograms that match these prompts, allowing the machine to create interesting and unique sounds. And it's not just limited to a single prompt. By using the latent space of Stable Diffusion, Riffusion can create sounds that span a range of prompts, resulting in complex and intriguing musical compositions.
<br/>
But don't expect Riffusion to replace human musicians anytime soon. The ability to produce longer-form clips is still theoretical, and Riffusion is more of a "wow, look at this" demo than any kind of grand plan to reinvent music. Still, it's an exciting development in the music industry, and other groups are exploring AI-generated music in various ways.
<br/>
The beauty of Riffusion is that it offers a fresh perspective on music creation. By using AI to analyze audio in a new way, it opens up new possibilities and creative avenues that were previously unexplored. Who knows what kind of music Riffusion and other AI music-making projects will create in the future? One thing's for sure, it's an exciting time to be a music lover.
