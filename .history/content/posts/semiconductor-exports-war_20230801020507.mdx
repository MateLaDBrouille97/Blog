China has announced export restrictions on gallium and germanium, two crucial elements used in semiconductor manufacturing, solar panels, fiber optics, and modern weapons. The move is seen as retaliation against the US and Western allies' restrictions on cutting-edge technology exports to China, which have hindered China's tech growth, particularly affecting companies like Huawei.
<br/>
While the restrictions have caused the prices of gallium and germanium to rise and triggered stockpiling, their niche applications in the semiconductor industry may limit the impact on the US compared to China's own losses from US export restrictions. China's dominance in the production of these materials has led to concerns about the supply chain, but other countries could increase production to substitute for China's supply.
<br/>
The timing of China's announcement follows the US government's efforts to persuade allies to restrict China's access to high-end chipmaking equipment. Some experts believe that this move is an attempt to exert leverage in trade negotiations and to secure critical materials in case of conflicts.
<br/>
China's export controls could push foreign importers to seek alternative sources and diversify supply chains. However, experts believe that China's measures may not be as effective as the US export controls, given the availability of alternative technologies in other markets and the US's advantages, such as the international importance of the dollar.
<br/>
China has a history of restricting exports of critical raw materials, as seen in its actions with rare-earth elements in the past. While Japan has threatened to raise the issue with the World Trade Organization (WTO), the organization's relevance has diminished, and China may find ways to justify its actions based on its essential security interests.
<br/>
Experts predict that China may implement more export controls in the future, possibly targeting materials used in electric-vehicle batteries or rare-earth elements. These materials could have a more significant impact due to their higher demand and lack of easy substitutes, giving China a potential advantage in future trade negotiations.

# ***Dutch semiconductor machine export restrictions to come into force in September***
<br/>
Starting from September, Dutch companies manufacturing advanced semiconductor processor chips will need export licenses before selling them abroad, according to an announcement by the Dutch government. Although the measure is said to be "country neutral," it is widely viewed as part of a broader U.S. policy aimed at limiting China's access to chip-making materials with potential military applications. The move will notably impact ASML, the Netherlands-based company that produces machines using extreme ultraviolet lithography for advanced semiconductor chip production. ASML has been prohibited from exporting some machines to China since 2019.
<br/>
The U.S. administration had imposed export controls in October to restrict China's access to advanced chips, encouraging allies like Japan and the Netherlands to follow suit. However, China condemned the latest restrictions, stating they are "completely unreasonable and untenable" and could harm Dutch companies, global supply chains, and the Netherlands' reputation as a supporter of free trade.
<br/>
Despite the restrictions on advanced machines, ASML has continued to ship lower-quality chip lithography systems to China. Now, the company will have to apply for export licenses for all shipments of its most advanced deep ultraviolet lithography systems. Dutch Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation Minister Liesje Schreinemacher emphasized that the restrictions were carefully considered to address vulnerabilities without unnecessarily disrupting chip production worldwide.

# ***‘An Act of War’: Inside America’s Silicon Blockade Against China***

<br />
In an effort to maintain America's technological edge and curb China's advancement in artificial intelligence and advanced technology, the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security (B.I.S.) implemented export controls on semiconductor chips. These chips are essential components powering everything from smartphones to data centers and are crucial for future innovations like quantum computing and AI.
<br/>
The controls aim to hinder China's ability to produce or purchase high-end chips, but their impact is far-reaching, affecting China's economic growth and scientific leadership. The Biden administration seeks to leverage America's dominance in the global semiconductor market, exploiting the interdependence of the industry. Three U.S. companies dominate chip-design software, and a few American or American-dependent companies control advanced chip-manufacturing tools, creating choke points in the supply chain.
<br/>
If successful, the controls could significantly set back China's technological progress. However, they also risk backfiring, accelerating China's pursuit of self-sufficiency and driving them to develop indigenous technology. China's strength lies in its supercomputing capabilities, with its most advanced projects and institutions relying heavily on U.S. technology. Still, the U.S. controls could limit China's access to these critical components and restrict its progress in AI and advanced technology.
<br/>
The outcome of these measures will have lasting implications for the global order and the competition between the United States and China in technological leadership. If the controls fail, they may inadvertently push China to become a formidable technological competitor, potentially hastening the future the U.S. is trying to prevent.

# ***The U.S. and Europe Are Growing Alarmed by China’s Rush Into Legacy Chips***
<br/>

<br />
U.S. and European officials are becoming increasingly concerned about China's rapid expansion in the production of older-generation semiconductors, known as legacy chips. President Joe Biden had implemented controls over China's access to advanced chips used in AI and military applications, but Beijing responded by investing heavily in legacy chip factories, which have not been banned. These legacy chips are crucial components in various industries, including smartphones, electric vehicles, and military hardware.
<br/>
The fear is that China's dominance in the legacy chip market could enable them to wield influence and potentially create national security risks for other countries reliant on these technologies. Western officials worry that China might flood global markets with cheap legacy chips, driving foreign rivals out of business, similar to what happened in the solar industry.
<br/>
Both the U.S. and Europe are working to bolster their domestic chip production to reduce reliance on Asia. However, the challenge lies in competing with heavily subsidized Chinese plants, which might deter Western companies from investing in new chip manufacturing facilities.
<br/>
While the U.S. implemented restrictions on China's advanced chipmaking capabilities, it left the older techniques mostly untouched, leading Chinese firms to build new plants faster than anywhere else in the world. Despite rising tensions, China continues to supply chips to the West due to heavy investments and technological advancements.
<br/>
As China's influence in the legacy chip market grows, U.S. and European officials are considering new strategies to contain China's expansion and prevent chips from becoming a leverage point for the country. The discussions are ongoing, and all options are being considered to address the economic and security concerns posed by China's push into legacy chip production.
