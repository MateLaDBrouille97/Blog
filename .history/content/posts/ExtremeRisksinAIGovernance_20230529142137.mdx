<br/>
The development of general-purpose AI systems has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of our lives, from healthcare to transportation. However, these systems also pose significant risks, including the possibility of unintended consequences or malicious use. To address these risks, experts have proposed the use of model evaluations for extreme risks as a critical tool in AI governance regimes. This PDF file provides an overview of the current state of research on this topic.
<br/>
The PDF file begins by outlining the scope and goals of model evaluations for extreme risks. The authors argue that a central goal of AI governance should be to limit the creation, deployment, and proliferation of systems that pose extreme risks. To achieve this goal, we need tools for evaluating whether a particular system poses such risks. The authors propose a framework for evaluating models based on their potential impact on society and the likelihood of that impact occurring.
<br/>
The PDF file then discusses early work in this area and outlines key design criteria for extreme risk evaluations. These criteria include transparency, accountability, and stakeholder involvement. The authors argue that evaluations should be transparent so that stakeholders can understand how decisions are made about model development and deployment. They also emphasize the importance of involving stakeholders in the evaluation process to ensure that their concerns are taken into account.
<br/>
Next, the PDF file discusses some limitations of model evaluations for extreme risks. For example, it may be difficult to predict all possible outcomes or unintended consequences of a particular system. Additionally, evaluations may not capture all relevant information about a system's potential impact on society.
<br/>
Finally, the PDF file concludes with high-level recommendations for AI developers and policymakers. These recommendations include developing clear guidelines for responsible training and deployment of AI systems, promoting transparency in decision-making processes related to AI development and deployment, and involving stakeholders in these processes.
<br/>
Model evaluation for extreme risks is an important tool in ensuring responsible and ethical development and deployment of AI systems. This PDF file provides a valuable overview of the current state of research on this topic, including early work in the area, key design criteria for evaluations, and potential limitations. The authors emphasize the importance of transparency, accountability, and stakeholder involvement in the evaluation process to ensure that AI systems are developed and used in a responsible manner.
