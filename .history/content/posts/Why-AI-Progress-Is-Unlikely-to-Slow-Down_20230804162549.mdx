Over the past decade, AI systems have made remarkable progress, advancing from defeating human players in complex games like Go to surpassing human abilities in recognizing images and speech, acing business school exams, and tackling coding interview questions. The pace of AI development has left many people feeling apprehensive about its rapid advancements.

<br />
AI progress is predominantly driven by three factors: compute, data, and algorithms. As computational power has increased, AI systems have been able to handle larger datasets, allowing them to learn from more examples and draw more accurate conclusions. The development of better algorithms has also significantly contributed to AI advancements, effectively optimizing computational usage.
<br/>
Compute power has steadily increased over the years, thanks to Moore's Law, which states that the number of transistors in integrated circuits doubles approximately every two years. This has led to the creation of larger-scale AI models, often involving substantial investments. Companies like OpenAI and Anthropic have raised billions to fund their AI projects, partnering with tech giants like Microsoft and Google.
<br/>
Data plays a vital role in training AI systems, with larger datasets leading to more accurate models. However, researchers predict that the availability of high-quality language data scraped from the internet might become limited by 2026. Nevertheless, experts believe that AI developers will find innovative ways to address this issue and continue progressing.
<br/>
Experts expect AI progress to continue at an accelerated rate for the foreseeable future. This rapid advancement has raised concerns, as it could lead to the democratization of scientific knowledge and potential misuse of AI in critical domains such as cybersecurity, nuclear technology, chemistry, and biology. As AI becomes more capable, careful regulation and ethical considerations will be crucial to mitigate potential risks.

# ***Alibaba takes AI fight to Meta with 2 open-source models***
<br/>
<Image src="/l35920230803181857.jpeg" alt="" width={600} height={500} />
<br />
On August 3, 2023, Alibaba Cloud, the cloud computing unit of Alibaba, unveiled two open-source AI models, Qwen-7B and Qwen-7B-Chat, each equipped with seven billion parameters. This move comes after Meta's release of the open-source Llama 2 model in the previous month. Analysts speculate that these open-source models could challenge the market dominance of AI giants OpenAI and Google, who charge high fees for their AI models.
<br/>
Alibaba announced that the code, model weights, and documentation of the two models will be freely available for academics, researchers, and commercial institutions. However, companies with over 100 million monthly active users will need to obtain a license from Alibaba to use these models. This follows a similar licensing requirement imposed by Meta for their Llama 2 model when a company has over 700 million users.
<br/>
The launch of these AI models is part of China's effort to close the AI gap with the US, as Beijing encourages the development of homegrown AI models to compete with American counterparts. Companies like Tencent Holdings and Huawei have also been actively working on their AI models. Alibaba Cloud had previously introduced its large language model, Tongyi Qianwen, in April, offering multiple versions with different parameter counts.

# ***AI investments to reach $200 billion by 2025: Goldman Sachs***
<br/>
Generative AI is poised to boost global labor productivity by 1%, according to a report by Goldman Sachs. The firm predicts that AI investments worldwide could reach $200 billion by 2025, with generative AI playing a significant role. This AI subsector uses large language models to create new content and is gaining interest across various industries.
<br/>
AI investment is expected to reach $100 billion, and American companies are likely to be early adopters, positioning the country as an AI innovation leader. The surge in AI investment could inject $4.4 trillion into the global economy annually, potentially representing up to 4% of US GDP and 2.5% of GDP in other investing countries like China. However, concerns remain about privacy and the displacement of human jobs by AI algorithms.

# ***CoreWeave came ‘out of nowhere.’ Now it’s poised to make billions off AI with its GPU cloud***
<br/>
<Image src="/Untitled-design-2023-08-01T110706.729.jpeg" alt="" width={600} height={500} />
<br />
CoreWeave, a once-obscure cloud startup focused on GPU-accelerated workloads, has risen to prominence in the generative AI boom, poised to make billions. Initially a cryptocurrency mining company using GPUs to verify blockchain transactions, CoreWeave pivoted to building a specialized cloud infrastructure offering GPU acceleration at scale. This shift caught the attention of the AI community, leading to significant investments. In a short span, the company secured over $400 million in funding, unveiled the world's fastest AI supercomputer in partnership with Nvidia, and is constructing 12 data centers.
<br/>
Nvidia's support has been crucial to CoreWeave's success. The AI chip manufacturer has allotted its latest AI server chips to CoreWeave instead of major cloud providers like AWS, who are developing their own AI chips to reduce reliance on Nvidia. This support from Nvidia has accelerated CoreWeave's growth, making them a key player in providing infrastructure for cutting-edge AI models.
<br/>
CoreWeave's clients include major AI companies like Inflection AI, who depend on CoreWeave's expertise to build high-performance supercomputers for AI research. Looking ahead, CoreWeave plans to expand into industries such as life sciences, providing the necessary computing power for drug discovery, molecular simulations, genetics testing, and more.
<br/>
CoreWeave's rapid rise to success is a testament to the growing importance of GPU-accelerated infrastructure in the AI industry and the crucial support provided by strategic partnerships like the one with Nvidia.
