The increasing presence of artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping the roles of both technology professionals and business managers, necessitating skill updates and adaptability. While there's uncertainty surrounding AI's impact on business careers, its influence on managerial and professional jobs is projected to be substantial.
<br/>
According to Rakesh Kochhar's analysis of Pew Research, AI, particularly generative AI, is likely to affect higher-paying jobs requiring analytical skills and higher education. Workers with bachelor's degrees (27%) are more inclined to be exposed to AI than those with only high school diplomas (12%).
<br/>
Despite this exposure, professionals in AI-affected industries often don't perceive their jobs as being threatened. Many believe AI will aid them more than harm them personally. 
<br/>
###Vittorio Cretella###, CIO of Procter & Gamble, supports this notion by emphasizing that AI should amplify human capabilities rather than replace them. He envisions AI changing work dynamics but still requiring digitally-savvy, creative human employees to collaborate effectively with machines.
<br/>
Cretella underscores the necessity for all employees, regardless of their roles, to adapt to working alongside machines, extracting insights, and utilizing machine-generated recommendations. He stresses that corporate leaders must prioritize investing in talent and upskilling while incorporating data science and machine learning capabilities. The goal is to foster a culture that encourages continuous learning and AI application to enhance business outcomes.
<br/>
Cretella contends that AI will complement, not substitute, human skills like curiosity, creativity, critical thinking, compassion, and collaboration. The most significant human impact will be in problem definition â€“ understanding the core issues before developing algorithmic solutions. He highlights that successful AI implementation involves defining problems, exploring data, and utilizing AI to find answers.
<br/>
Ultimately, the future of management lies in AI-savvy business leaders who are curious, unbiased, and comprehend the organizational elements required to leverage data and machine learning. While technology is transformative, the driving force of change remains rooted in people's abilities and understanding of societal needs.

# ***OpenAI's ChatGPT Joins the Ranks in Top 1% for Original Creative Thinking***
<br/>

<br />
Research conducted by the University of Montana reveals that AI, specifically represented by ChatGPT, demonstrates remarkable creative thinking abilities, surpassing the creativity performance of even the top 1% of humans on the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT), a recognized creativity assessment. Led by Dr. Erik Guzik, an assistant clinical professor at the University of Michigan's College of Business, the study aimed to gauge AI's innovative potential.
<br/>
The study compared responses from 24 University of Michigan students in entrepreneurship and personal finance classes to a control group, as well as data from 2,700 college students who took the TTCT exam in 2016. The role of AI in this process was undisclosed to the independent adjudicator, Scholastic Testing Service. ChatGPT excelled in generating numerous ideas and achieved a top percentile score for originality. Although its capacity to produce a variety of ideas experienced a slight dip (97th percentile), it still ranked among the most creative thinkers.
<br/>
The research displayed ChatGPT's creative prowess, previously untapped in AI, and indicated its potential in reshaping business by merging innovation and entrepreneurial thought. Guzik believes that as AI technology advances, it could become a crucial tool in enhancing both local and national creativity, revolutionizing business strategies and practices. Despite AI's inability to generate entirely novel solutions, the improvements brought by GPT-4 have propelled it to match the top 1% of human responses in creative thinking

# ***Multinationals turn to generative AI to manage supply chains***
<br/>
Major companies like Unilever, Siemens, and Maersk are increasingly turning to artificial intelligence (AI) to navigate intricate supply chains affected by geopolitical tensions and demands to address environmental and human rights issues. These firms are employing AI for tasks such as negotiating contracts, finding new suppliers, and identifying connections to sensitive matters like alleged human rights abuses in China's Xinjiang region. The emergence of generative AI technology has enabled further automation in supply chain management.
<br/>
The COVID-19 pandemic and escalating geopolitical tensions have compelled multinational companies to closely monitor their suppliers and adapt to disruptions. New supply chain laws, like those in Germany, necessitate companies to track environmental and human rights concerns within their supply chains, fueling interest and investment in AI-enabled supply chain management. Generative AI, capable of creating software like chatbots that respond to human prompts, has proven transformative for these efforts.
<br/>
Companies like Pactum, which employs a ChatGPT-like bot, have secured funding from major players like Maersk to facilitate AI-driven contract negotiations with suppliers. Siemens has also partnered with Scoutbee, a startup using AI to locate alternative suppliers and vulnerabilities in supply chains. Altana, another AI-powered startup, aids in building global supply chain maps by analyzing customs declarations and shipping documents, enabling product tracing and identification.
<br/>
Despite the promise of AI in enhancing supply chain efficiency, concerns about potential job cuts due to AI adoption remain prevalent among supply chain professionals. While up to 96% of surveyed executives plan to adopt AI technology, only 14% currently use it.
