# What is Copy.AI ?
<br/>

Copy.ai is an AI-powered writing tool that was founded in 2020 and specializes in generating content for websites, landing pages, sales letters, social media, and email marketing.
Its primary focus is on creating digital ad copy and product descriptions. The platform is easy to use, and its YouTube channel has a lot of well-produced video content that can take users step-by-step through creating each type of copy that they need.
The tool is best suited for digital marketers and online business owners looking to save time and speed up their copywriting and content creation processes. While the tool is useful for creating general topics, it can be less accurate for more specific topics.
The AI writer is helpful for generating content quickly, but users should not expect it to write high-quality long-form content without any issues. It should be used more as an assistant during the content creation process and is most effective when used in tandem with content optimization tools such as Grammarly.
Copy.ai has a free 7-day trial that users can take advantage of to test out all the features for themselves.
