# Mineral requirements for clean energy transitions
<br />
The demand for minerals in clean energy technologies is expected to increase significantly in the next two decades. Electric vehicles (EVs) and battery storage will account for about half of the mineral demand growth, with graphite, copper, and nickel being the dominant minerals. Solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind power will also contribute to mineral demand growth, driven by capacity additions and higher mineral intensity. The use of hydrogen in fuel cell electric vehicles and electrolysers will increase the demand for nickel, zirconium, copper, and platinum-group metals. Rare earth elements (REEs) will see significant growth in demand for EV motors and wind turbines. Clean energy technologies are set to become the fastest-growing segment of demand for most minerals, but projections are subject to uncertainty. Governments need to provide strong and consistent signals about their climate ambitions to reduce uncertainty and support the mining and processing industries.

# The Role of Critical Minerals in Clean Energy Transitions

The transition to clean energy technologies has significant implications for mineral demand. Solar photovoltaic (PV) plants, wind farms, and electric vehicles (EVs) require more minerals than traditional hydrocarbon-based energy sources. For example, an electric car requires six times the minerals of a conventional car, and an onshore wind plant requires nine times more minerals than a gas-fired plant. The shift to clean energy is expected to drive a substantial increase in mineral requirements, with renewables becoming the fastest-growing segment of demand. This increase in demand poses challenges in terms of supply availability, price volatility, and the need for diversified supply chains. Policy makers and industry stakeholders must address these challenges to ensure a smooth and sustainable energy transition.

# Visualizing China’s Dominance in Clean Energy Metals
<br/>

<br />
China is the largest producer of clean energy metals, despite being the world's biggest carbon polluter, according to data from the International Energy Agency. China produces 60% of all rare earth elements and has a 13% share of the lithium production market. It also dominates the processing operations, with significant shares in refining nickel, lithium, cobalt, and rare earth elements. In contrast, the United States does not appear among the top producers of these metals. The Democratic Republic of Congo is a major source of cobalt, with Chinese interests owning most of the industrial cobalt operations there. However, the DRC's cobalt production has been criticized for corruption and lack of regulation. The global shift towards renewable energy raises questions about how geopolitics and supply chains will be affected, with China currently leading in clean energy metal production.

# Should You Invest in Disruptive Materials?
<br/>

<br />
New technologies in transportation and energy sectors are driving the demand for disruptive materials, which are essential components for innovation. These materials, including zinc, palladium, platinum, nickel, lithium, graphene, rare earth materials, copper, cobalt, and carbon fiber, play crucial roles in climate technologies and emerging technologies. With the global effort to decarbonize and combat climate change, disruptive materials are expected to experience a demand supercycle, leading to rising prices. The International Energy Agency predicts significant growth in demand for these materials by 2040, particularly for lithium, graphite, cobalt, nickel, manganese, rare earth elements, and copper. The Global X Disruptive Materials ETF (DMAT) provides investment opportunities to gain exposure to this growing demand.

# Tech for Climate 
<br/>
<Youtube id= "FNvT-0f_11Q"/>
<br/>
Technology plays a crucial role in the transition towards a more sustainable and resilient world. Experts and companies engaged in this transition recognize both the potential and the limits of technology.
<br/>
Aurore Stephant, a mining engineer specialized in environmental and health risks of mineral supply chains, emphasizes the need to use technology to reduce the environmental and social impacts of mining. 
However, she also warns against the illusion of a technological fix and highlights the importance of a holistic approach that considers the entire supply chain and involves stakeholders.
<br/>
Hugues Ferreboeuf, a speaker on engineering and management of transitions, stresses the need to shift from a linear, resource-intensive economy to a circular, regenerative one. 
He advocates for the use of technology to enable this transition, but warns against the risk of rebound effects and the need to consider the entire system.
<br/>
Lionel Fournier, Director of Health and Ecology at Harmonie Mutuelle and Director of Sustainable Development at the Vyv Group, emphasizes the role of technology in improving health and well-being, for example through telemedicine or smart buildings. 
He also highlights the need to address the digital divide and ensure that technology benefits all.
<br/>
Véronique Torner, a member of the Executive Committee and administrator of Numeum in charge of the Responsible Digital program, emphasizes the need to ensure that technology is used responsibly, taking into account its environmental and social impacts. 
She advocates for the use of digital tools to enable a more sustainable and inclusive economy, but warns against the risks of data privacy and security breaches.
