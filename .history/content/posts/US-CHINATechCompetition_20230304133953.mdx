China's leading search engine, Baidu, has announced that it plans to roll out its own "Ernie Bot" chatbot, following the success of similar tools in the US.
Alibaba and JD.com are among the other Chinese tech giants that have also announced plans to launch chatbots. China has been working on developing artificial 
intelligence capabilities since 2017, aiming to become a global innovation centre in the sector by 2030. 
However, there are concerns that the deteriorating relationship between China and the US could lead to difficulties in collaboration, particularly as the countries
 have different approaches to AI regulation.
