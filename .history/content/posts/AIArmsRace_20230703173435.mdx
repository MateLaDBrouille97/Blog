Tortoise Media has released its fourth edition of The Global AI Index, which ranks nations based on their AI development. The index considers three pillars: investment, innovation, and implementation. The United States secured the top position with a score of 100, leading in all three pillars, particularly in investment due to high startup activity. China came in second with a score of 62, maintaining its position from the previous year. Singapore showed significant growth, surpassing the UK to secure the fourth position. Singapore's ranking improved from tenth in 2020 to sixth in 2021 and further to fourth in 2023, scoring 50 out of 100. The rankings also highlight countries leading in AI intensity, considering AI capacity relative to their population and economy size. Singapore, Israel, and Switzerland topped the list in terms of intensity. 
<br/>
The rankings reflect the performance of countries in the AI domain, and as more nations allocate resources and compete in the AI race, the rankings are expected to undergo further shifts in the future. The Global AI Index serves as a valuable tool for assessing the progress and advancements made by various countries in the field of artificial intelligence. With the recent surge in generative developments, as seen with the launch and success of ChatGPT, the global AI arms race is intensifying, and countries are striving to establish dominance in this rapidly evolving field.

### ***Nvidia teams up with Snowflake for large language model AI***
<br/>
Nvidia has emerged as the dominant player in the latest benchmark tests conducted by MLCommons, surpassing its competitors Google, Graphcore, and Advanced Micro Devices. The MLPerf tests measure chip speed in training neural networks, and Nvidia achieved top marks across all eight tests. While Intel's Habana business provided meaningful competition with its Guadi2 chip, Nvidia's performance remained superior. Intel aims to surpass Nvidia's H100 GPU by fall. The benchmark tests focused on training neural networks, with a new task involving the GPT-3 large language model, where Nvidia excelled. Despite the absence of some competitors, the test continues to attract new system makers.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to automate 40% of daily work, making it crucial for leaders to leverage AI in decision-making. The automation trend is already underway, with workers automating an average of 20% of tasks in the past two years using low-code and no-code platforms. Educators need to prepare students for the future of work, as research shows that only 11% of students feel well-prepared. To succeed in the modern workplace, individuals should focus on self-awareness, develop foresight, and build their community. Educators should integrate diversity and inclusion, bring in external speakers, and encourage teamwork and presentations in their courses.
