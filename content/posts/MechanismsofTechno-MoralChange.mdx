This paper discusses the relationship between technology and moral change, providing a taxonomy of mechanisms through which technology alters moral beliefs and practices. The authors argue that technology plays an active role in mediating human morality and can lead to changes in how people perceive the Good and the Right, as well as how they act on those perceptions.
<br/>
The paper begins by acknowledging that technology has always challenged and shaped concepts such as privacy, and with the emergence of the internet and digital convenience, people's notions of privacy and related rights and duties have been challenged and are in flux. Previous scholarship has explored individual case studies, theoretical patterns of moral and social change, and the moral and practical implications of technologically-mediated moral change.
<br/>
The authors aim to contribute to this literature by providing a synoptic account of the primary mechanisms through which technology can alter human morality. They describe six specific mechanisms and consider their layered, interactive, and second-order effects. While they acknowledge that their taxonomy is not exhaustive, they believe it provides a basis for future research in this area.
<br/>
The paper discusses the contested nature of the concept of technology, contrasting instrumentalist and cultural understandings. For the purposes of this paper, the authors adopt a largely materialist-instrumentalist understanding of technology as material artifacts created by humans to accomplish goals. They highlight Don Ihde's framework of technological mediation, which describes how technology can mediate human relations with the world. They also discuss Peter Paul Verbeek's theory of the moral mediating effect of technology.
<br/>
The authors then explore the existing research on technology and moral change, noting that technology plays a significant role in changing how humans perceive moral values and make moral choices. They highlight the need for a synoptic account of the mechanisms of moral change, which can enhance scholarly discourse and assist designers, engineers, policymakers, and activists in understanding and addressing the moral impact of technology.
<br/>
The paper presents a taxonomy of mechanisms of moral change, beginning with the first mechanism: technology changes option sets. Technology introduces new options into decision-making processes, which can have moral dimensions. For example, smartphones with internet connectivity and social media apps provide new options for distraction and sharing experiences. However, technology can also take options away, such as when the construction of low-lying bridges limited access to public beaches for certain groups.
<br/>
The paper concludes by emphasizing that its goal is to explain and understand the mechanisms of moral change rather than defend any particular thesis. The framework provided can serve as a useful tool for those interested in understanding and addressing the impacts of technology on social morality.
