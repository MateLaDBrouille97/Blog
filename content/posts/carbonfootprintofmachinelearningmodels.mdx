The report distinguishes between direct and indirect impacts of AI on the environment. Direct impacts result from the AI compute resources lifecycle, including resource consumption, energy use, and greenhouse gas emissions, while the latter come from AI applications, which can be either positive or negative.
<br />
While AI has the potential to help achieve global sustainability goals, the report highlights that AI training and deployment require significant computational resources, which have their own environmental impacts. The computational needs of AI systems are growing, raising sustainability concerns. According to the report, the computing demands of AI systems have grown dramatically, entering what some call the "Large-Scale Era" of compute. This growth has raised questions about whether hardware efficiency gains can continue to keep pace with AI compute demands.
<br />
To tackle these issues, the report recommends that policymakers establish measurement standards and expand data collection to better understand AI's environmental impacts. They should also address the measurement gaps that have policy implications and look beyond operational energy use and emissions to improve transparency and equity.
<br />
The report also highlights concerns about an AI compute divide between private and public actors and between advanced and emerging countries, which could undermine efforts to promote environmental equity. To address these concerns, the report recommends sharing best practices on the sustainable design and operations of AI compute and applications.
<br />
AI has the potential to promote economic growth and social well-being while also helping achieve global sustainability goals. However, as AI systems continue to grow and require significant computational resources, it's important to understand their environmental impacts. The OECD report recommends establishing measurement standards and expanding data collection to aid policymakers in understanding AI's environmental impacts. Sharing best practices on the sustainable design and operations of AI compute and applications can contribute to the development of skills for efficient and sustainable management of AI compute and its responsible application.
