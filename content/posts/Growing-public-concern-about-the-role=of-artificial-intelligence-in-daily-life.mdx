According to a recent survey conducted by the Pew Research Center, a growing number of Americans express concern about the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in their daily lives. The study surveyed 11,201 U.S. adults and found that 52% feel more concerned than excited about the increased use of AI, while only 10% feel more excited than concerned. This represents a 14 percentage point increase in concern since December 2022. The survey also found that older adults are more concerned about AI than younger adults, with 61% of those aged 65 and older expressing concern compared to 42% of those aged 18 to 29. 
<br/>
The rise in concern about AI is accompanied by a growing awareness of the technology, with 90% of adults having heard either a lot or a little about AI. Those who have heard a lot about AI are more likely to express concern than excitement. 
<br/>
Opinions about the impact of AI in specific areas are more mixed. For instance, 49% of respondents believe that AI helps more than hurts when it comes to finding products and services online. However, when it comes to privacy, 53% of Americans believe that AI is doing more to hurt than help in keeping personal information private. 
<br/>
Demographic differences also play a role in perceptions of AI. Those with higher levels of education and income tend to view AI as more helpful, while men tend to view AI's impact more positively than women. 
<br/>
The results of this survey indicate that while there is growing concern about AI, public opinions are still developing and vary depending on the specific use case and demographic factors.

# ***What Americans Know About AI, Cybersecurity and Big Tech***
<br/>
A study conducted by Pew Research Center found that while most U.S. adults can identify a secure password, far fewer can recognize an example of two-factor authentication. The study surveyed 5,101 U.S. adults and found that Americans answered a median of five out of nine questions correctly regarding digital knowledge. Only 4% of participants were able to answer all nine questions correctly, while 26% could answer at least seven questions accurately. The understanding of digital issues varied by age and educational attainment, with college graduates performing better than those with a high school education or less. This was particularly evident in topics such as two-factor authentication, cookies, deepfakes, and large language models. The study also highlighted that age differences affected digital knowledge, with adults under 50 generally performing better than those 50 and older. For example, younger adults were more likely to correctly identify two-factor authentication, deepfakes, and how large language models work. However, there were more modest age differences in knowledge about privacy laws and major technology companies. Overall, the study suggests that while Americans have some understanding of digital topics, there are notable gaps in knowledge, especially regarding advanced cybersecurity practices and emerging technologies.

# ***As AI Spreads, Experts Predict the Best and Worst Changes in Digital Life by 2035***
<br/>
In a recent report, experts in technology and digital innovation shared their expectations for the future of digital technology and its impact on society by 2035. While they anticipate significant benefits in areas such as healthcare, education, and scientific advancements, they also expressed concerns about the potential harm and negative consequences that may arise.
<br/>
On the positive side, experts foresee advancements in healthcare, with the development of personalized medicine and wearable technology that keeps people connected and informed about their health. They also anticipate progress in education, with digital tools and systems enhancing learning experiences in both formal and informal settings. Additionally, they expect improvements in environmental sustainability and climate action.
<br/>
However, experts also have fears about the darker sides of these advances. Some worry that artificial intelligence (AI) poses risks to humanity, including the potential for extinction. Others express concerns about the misuse of digital technology, such as the spread of misinformation and surveillance of populations. They also worry about the impact on jobs, global wealth inequality, and the weaponization of social media platforms.
<br/>
Experts believe that the choices humans make in utilizing technology will shape its impact on society. They emphasize the importance of ethical design, regulation, and the protection of human rights in the digital realm. They also stress the need for digital literacy and critical thinking skills to combat misinformation and maintain a healthy digital environment.
<br/>
While the experts see great potential for positive change through digital technology, they also recognize the significant challenges and risks that come with it. They call for responsible and inclusive development and use of technology to ensure that its benefits outweigh its harmful consequences.
