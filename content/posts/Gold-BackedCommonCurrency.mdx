The BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) are reportedly planning to introduce a new currency backed by gold as an alternative to the U.S. dollar. An official announcement is expected to be made at the BRICS summit in Johannesburg, South Africa, in August. The objective of this common currency is to boost intra-BRICS trade and reduce the costs associated with converting currencies for international transactions.
<br/>
The introduction of a gold-backed currency by the BRICS nations could potentially challenge the hegemony of the U.S. dollar in the global fiat money system. Economist Thorsten Polleit believes that a new international transaction unit backed by gold could be seen as "good money." However, he highlights the importance of convertibility into gold on demand to ensure its credibility as a sound currency. The details regarding the convertibility of the new currency into gold are yet to be clarified by the BRICS countries.
<br/>
Polleit also suggests the possibility of setting up a new bank for foreign trade that acquires capital in the form of gold provided by the BRICS nations. This bank could offer financing loans to exporters and issue the new currency or facilitate trade with gold as a backing.
<br/>
While the introduction of a gold-backed currency by the BRICS nations could have significant implications for the global fiat money system, it is important to wait for further details and clarification regarding the implementation and convertibility of the new currency.

### ***Where Central Banks Have Issued Digital Currencies***
<br/>
Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are gaining popularity worldwide as a different approach to cryptocurrency. Unlike decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, CBDCs are controlled by governments and operate similarly to traditional currencies. Several small nations and Nigeria have already launched their own CBDCs, and larger countries like the European Union, Canada, Brazil, and the United States are making plans to follow suit.

<br />
Pilot phases for CBDCs are underway in countries such as Russia, Thailand, India, South Korea, Sweden, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia. The Bahamas was the first country to introduce a CBDC called the Sand Dollar in 2019, which led to its adoption in other Caribbean nations.
<br/>
China, like Nigeria, has a strong digital payment infrastructure and is piloting its digital Yuan. The implementation of CBDCs in developing countries also aims to reach the unbanked population. One of the motivations for governments to adopt CBDCs is data collection. In China, where digital payments are already prevalent, the digital Yuan will provide even more data on people's spending habits, although the central bank claims it will ensure "controllable anonymity." In contrast, Europeans have expressed concerns about payment privacy in relation to the digital euro.
<br/>
Overall, CBDCs represent a shift towards government-controlled digital currencies that can provide benefits such as improved financial inclusion and enhanced data collection. The global trend towards CBDCs highlights the evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies and the potential impact on traditional financial systems.
