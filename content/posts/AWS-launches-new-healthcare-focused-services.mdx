Amazon introduced AWS HealthScribe, an AI-powered platform aimed at assisting healthcare professionals with transcription and analysis of patient interactions. The platform offers an API that creates transcripts, extracts details, and generates summaries from doctor-patient conversations for electronic health record (EHR) entry. Machine learning models within HealthScribe can convert these transcripts into patient notes, which can be further analyzed for valuable insights.
<br/>
The platform's AI capabilities are built on Bedrock, Amazon's generative AI platform that utilizes pretrained models from startups and Amazon itself. HealthScribe identifies speaker roles and segments transcripts into categories based on clinical relevance, such as "small talk," "subjective comments," or "objective comments." It also employs natural language processing to extract structured medical terms like medications and medical conditions.
<br/>
However, concerns have been raised regarding the reliability and potential biases of AI systems, especially with speech recognition and generative AI models. To address this, Amazon allows clinicians to review AI-generated notes before finalizing EHR records and ensures customer data privacy and security by not retaining data after processing requests and encrypting data at transit and at rest.
<br/>
Currently, HealthScribe is limited to providing clinical notes for two medical specialties: general medicine and orthopedics. While it is "HIPAA eligible," it is not compliant out of the box with the U.S. law that protects personal health information. However, healthcare software providers can reach compliance by working with Amazon and signing a business associate addendum.
<br/>
Amazon also announced AWS HealthImaging, a service to store, transform, and analyze medical imaging data at a large scale, offering potential cost savings for organizations in the healthcare industry. HealthImaging is now generally available in various AWS regions.

# ***Amazon expands Bedrock with conversational agents and new third-party models***
<br/>

<br />
Amazon made a significant stride towards a generative AI future at the AWS Summit New York, where they introduced Agents for Bedrock. Bedrock is Amazon's platform for building generative AI-powered applications using pretrained models from both startups and Amazon itself. Agents, in this context, allows users to create conversational agents that can provide personalized and up-to-date answers based on proprietary data and execute actions.
<br/>
Swami Sivasubramanian, AWS's VP of machine learning, highlighted that companies can use Agents to create customer service chatbots capable of processing orders by leveraging internal information like customer profiles and return policies for customizing each order. This move is reminiscent of OpenAI's plugins system for their generative text AI, GPT-4, and ChatGPT, which enable access to third-party APIs and databases.
<br/>
Startups like LlamaIndex and Contextual AI have also been developing tools that augment generative models with enterprise data, indicating a trend toward personalized generative models.
<br/>
To utilize Bedrock Agents effectively, the AI models need to be trained to "reason" through prompts that include definitions and instructions. Amazon has developed the AI models powering Agents in-house as part of the Titan family of AI models. However, they are also incorporating several models from third-party sources, like Anthropic's Claude 2 text-generating AI and Stability AI's Stable Diffusion XL 1.0, among others.
<br/>
While Bedrock faced initial challenges, Amazon's commitment to expanding its library of models indicates its seriousness about the generative AI field. With AWS's extensive reach and computational capabilities, Bedrock stands a good chance of gaining traction in the market over time.

# ***Generative AI capabilities come to Amazon QuickSight***
<br/>
Amazon QuickSight, the business intelligence service, is receiving upgrades powered by generative AI. These enhancements, announced at the AWS Summit in New York, will enable QuickSight to generate visuals, fine-tune and format them based on natural language instructions, and perform calculations without the need for specific syntax.
<br/>
A new feature called "Ask Q" will be added to the QuickSight home dashboard, allowing users to describe the data they want to visualize using natural language queries. For example, users can ask for visuals related to "top customers" or "shoe sales in San Antonio for 2020 by month." After generating the visualization, users can further refine it by applying filters or changing metrics.
<br/>
Another upcoming feature is the "Build for me" option, which lets users edit dashboard elements using natural language commands. By selecting a visual, typing a command like "change to a bar chart" or "change the date axis to monthly," QuickSight's generative AI will make the necessary adjustments.
<br/>
Additionally, QuickSight's generative AI can create "Stories," which are visual narratives based on natural language prompts. Users can create Stories by entering descriptions, and QuickSight will incorporate relevant visuals, text-based outlines, and data analyses related to business problems.
<br/>
While Amazon claims to have built the generative AI using proven technology, there are concerns about its reliability, given the potential for AI models to invent facts, exhibit biases, and generate problematic content. Users are advised to use the generative AI features with caution and oversight, despite the underlying technology's track record.
