Chicago-based startup Augmedics has secured $82.5 million in Series D funding to further develop its augmented reality (AR) platform for spinal surgeries. The round was led by CPMG, with participation from Evidity Health Capital, H.I.G. Capital, Revival Healthcare Capital, and Almeda Ventures. The latest investment brings Augmedics' total funding to $148 million. Augmedics' platform, called "xvision," uses AR technology to provide surgeons with enhanced visualization during spinal surgeries, giving them a real-time, detailed view of a patient's spine based on CT scans. This eliminates the need for fluoroscopy, a chemical-based process involving x-rays. The technology has already been approved by the FDA and has been used in over 4,000 procedures since its market deployment in 2020. With the new funding, Augmedics plans to build the next generation of its platform, combining software with custom-made hardware, and expand its commercial development. The company also aims to explore opportunities beyond spinal surgeries, including other musculoskeletal areas and cranial procedures. Despite the challenges faced by many medtech startups, Augmedics' proven track record and unique AR navigation solution have attracted investors and positioned the company as a leader in the augmented reality surgery space.

<br/>
Databricks, a data and AI platform, announced its acquisition of MosaicML, an open-source startup specializing in neural networks and generative AI tools. The deal, worth $1.3 billion, will see MosaicML integrate its platform into Databricks' Lakehouse Platform, offering organizations the ability to build and deploy large language models (LLMs) based on their own data. MosaicML's approach focuses on empowering organizations to create their own LLMs cost-effectively. With this acquisition, Databricks aims to democratize AI and make the Lakehouse the ideal environment for generative AI and LLM development. The MosaicML team will join Databricks after the deal's completion.

### ***This week in AI: Big Tech bets billions on machine learning tools***
<br/>
This week in the world of AI, the competitive landscape in generative AI continued to heat up with major players like Dropbox, AWS, Salesforce Ventures, Workday, Accenture, and PwC investing significant amounts of money in AI-powered products and technologies. However, Meredith Whittaker, the president of Signal, highlighted the opaque nature of AI algorithms and the need for more transparency and accountability in the field. In other news, DeepMind developed an AI model called RoboCat that can perform tasks across different robotic arms, while CMU showcased an AI system called VRB that trains robots using recorded human demonstrations. Additionally, various companies introduced AI-powered features and tools, and the European Consumer Organisation called for urgent investigations into the risks of generative AI. At the CVPR conference, interesting topics included the limitations of language models like GPT-4, the history of machine learning concepts, and noteworthy research papers on topics such as meta-models for visual manipulation, planning-oriented autonomous driving, and interacting with videos using neural radiance fields.
