<br/>
I'm assuming your **Next.js project** is already set up.
In order to avoid confusion, I'll be focusing more on the **pages** and **src/utils** folders of this app.
<br/>

# Read the Markdown (MDX) Files
<br/>
In a typical blog, we'd need to write blog posts or articles. 
In this blog, I am using markdown (MDX) to write our articles, which is why you can see that we have two .mdx files inside the data/articles directory. 
You can have more than that, as far as the number of articles you want to write goes.
<br/>
To begin, our efforts will be focused on the creation of several reusable functions that will be contained within the **src/utils/mdx.js** file. 
These functions will be utilized in conjunction with Node.js' FileSystem API. 
It is essential to note that these functions will be called from the server-side within the pages folder. 
This is necessary as Next.js employs specific data-fetching methods that must be executed on the server. 
As such, the server-side implementation of these functions is imperative to ensure optimal performance and functionality.
<br/>
## Dependancies
<br/>
```js
npm install gray-matter reading-time next-mdx-remote glob dayjs
```
<br/>
To better comprehend the upcoming processes, it is vital to familiarize ourselves with the fundamental functions of the packages we installed.
Firstly, **gray-matter** will parse the content contained within the **.mdx** files and convert them into readable HTML content. 
**Reading-time** is a package that assigns an estimated time to read an article based on its word count. 
This is an excellent feature to have, as it provides readers with a quick glance at the article's length and whether or not they have sufficient time to read it.
**Next-mdx-remote** is a powerful tool that performs the background compilation of MDX files. 
By allowing them to be loaded within Next.js' **getStaticProps** or **getServerSideProps** data-fetching methods, they can be appropriately hydrated on the client. 
This feature ensures optimal performance and functionality, as it reduces the load on the server and provides a seamless user experience.
Additionally, **glob** gives us access to match the file patterns in data/articles, which we'll be using as the slug of the article. 
**Dayjs** is a JavaScript library that helps parse, manipulate, validate, and display dates that we would be adding to the metadata of each article.
Now that we have a basic understanding of the packages we installed, we can begin writing the functions that will read the files in the articles directory. 
These functions will form the foundation of our project and will be essential in fetching and rendering the articles on our website.
<br/>
<br/>
In **src/utils/mdx.js** :
<br/>
```js
import path from 'path'
import fs from 'fs'
import matter from 'gray-matter'
import readingTime from 'reading-time'
import { sync } from 'glob'

const articlesPath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'data/articles')

export async function getSlug() {
  const paths = sync(`${articlesPath}/*.mdx`)

  return paths.map((path) => {
    // holds the paths to the directory of the article
    const pathContent = path.split('/')
    const fileName = pathContent[pathContent.length - 1]
    const [slug, _extension] = fileName.split('.')

    return slug
  })
}
```
<br/>
The first variable declaration, **articlesPath**, holds the path to where all the articles can be found.
To locate the articles, we're utilizing the path module, which allows us to access the articles directory via the process API of Node.js. 
This API grants us direct access to the cwd() (Current Working Directory) object.
For the **getSlug** function, we're using the **articlesPath** variable that we previously declared and passing it to the **glob** package's sync function. 
This will match any file with the **.mdx** extension and return an array of those files. 
This function is used to retrieve a unique article when a user clicks on it from the blog page.
<br/>
```js
const paths = sync(`${articlesPath}/*.mdx`)
```
<br/>
With that being said, we'll return an array of modified file names. 
The **pathContent** variable holds the path to all the articles in the articles directory, so we're using JavaScript to remove all the "forward-slashes" with the **split()** method of JavaScript.
<br/>
```js
const fileName = pathContent[pathContent.length - 1]
const [slug, _extension] = fileName.split('.')
```
<br/>
The fileName variable in the **getSlug** function uses the **path.basename()** method to extract the last part of the path. 
For instance, if the path is **/data/articles/example-post.mdx**, the method will return **/example-post.mdx**. 
The next line of code then uses the **String.prototype.replace()** method to remove the **.mdx** extension from the file name, leaving us with just **example-post** as the slug.
It's important to note that this process of getting the slug is important because it allows us to match the file name with the URL slug when the user navigates to a specific article. 
This helps us to retrieve the correct article and display it on the page.
<br/>
<br/>
## Parse Article Content from the Slug
<br/>
The next function gets and parses the content in our MDX files from the slugs. 
It returns an object of metadata that we'll be using as we progress.
<br/>
```js
export async function getArticleFromSlug(slug) {
  const articleDir = path.join(articlesPath, `${slug}.mdx`)
  const source = fs.readFileSync(articleDir)
  const { content, data } = matter(source)

  return {
    content,
    frontmatter: {
      slug,
      excerpt: data.excerpt,
      title: data.title,
      publishedAt: data.publishedAt,
      readingTime: readingTime(source).text,
      ...data,
    },
  }
}
```
<br/>
It's important to note that using synchronous functions like **readFileSync** can have an impact on the performance of your application, as it can potentially block the event loop and cause the application to become unresponsive. 
Asynchronous functions like **readFile** are often preferred for this reason, as they allow other processes to continue while the operation is being performed.
However, in this case, we're using **readFileSync** because we want to ensure that we have all the data from the file before moving on to the next step of processing it. 
This is necessary for our application to work correctly.
Once we have the file content, we pass it through the **gray-matter** package to parse the frontmatter (metadata) and the content of the file. 
We then use the reading-time package to calculate the approximate time it would take to read the article based on the word count.
Finally, we return an object that contains all the relevant information for the article, including the title, slug, date, content, reading time, and any other metadata that may have been included in the **frontmatter**.

As mentioned earlier, **gray-matter** is a package that parses the markdown content in the source to readable HTML. 
In the code snippet above, we are using destructuring assignment to extract the content and data variables from the returned object of the matter function. 
The matter function parses the source content using **gray-matter** and returns an object containing both the content and the **frontmatter** data.
The content variable holds the markdown content of the article, while data holds the frontmatter data that we've defined in the **.mdx** file. 
We'll use these variables in the next steps to extract the necessary information from each article.
<br/>
```js
const { content, data } = matter(source)

return {
  content,
  frontmatter: {
    slug,
    excerpt: data.excerpt,
    title: data.title,
    publishedAt: data.publishedAt,
    readingTime: readingTime(source).text,
    ...data,
  },
}
```
<br/>
We need a way to display all the articles on the blog page. 
The function below does that for us, by utilizing the **reduce()** method of JavaScript to return an array of all the articles in the articles directory.
<br/>
```js
export async function getAllArticles() {
  const articles = fs.readdirSync(path.join(process.cwd(), 'data/articles'))

  return articles.reduce((allArticles, articleSlug) => {
    // get parsed data from mdx files in the "articles" dir
    const source = fs.readFileSync(
      path.join(process.cwd(), 'data/articles', articleSlug),
      'utf-8'
    )
    const { data } = matter(source)

    return [
      {
        ...data,
        slug: articleSlug.replace('.mdx', ''),
        readingTime: readingTime(source).text,
      },
      ...allArticles,
    ]
  }, [])
}
```
<br/>
You can see how we're using **readdirSync()** to synchronously read all the files inside **data/articles**. 
The source variable can be accessed by reading all the files with their respective slugs and getting their content parsed with the **gray-matter** package.
<br/>
```js
const source = fs.readFileSync(
  path.join(process.cwd(), 'data/articles', articleSlug),
  'utf-8'
)
const { data } = matter(source)
```
<br/>
In the snippet above, we're using the reading-time package to estimate the time it will take to read an article. 
To achieve this, we pass the content of the article — which we've already read and parsed using the **gray-matter** package — to the **readingTime** function. 
This returns an object with a text property that contains an estimated time to read the article.
To get the slug that will be attached to this article, we strip the last part of the article's path by using the basename function from the path module. 
Then, we replace the **.mdx** extension with an empty string to make the slug more readable. 
This way, the slug can be accessed via "blog/example-post" instead of **blog/example-post.mdx**.
<br/>
```js
{
  slug: articleSlug.replace('.mdx', ''),
  readingTime: readingTime(source).text,
}
```
<br/>
The readingTime has some methods that you can assign to it, one of them is the text method. 
You can try removing this value, saving your code, and allowing Next.js to throw an error, so you can get a glimpse of the values that you can use.
<br/>
<br/>
## Display a List of Articles
<br/>
We'll start with the **index** file in the blog folder. In this file, we'll be using the data-fetching method — **getStaticProps** — to render the articles on the page.
<br/>
```js
import { getAllArticles } from '../../src/utils/mdx'

export async function getStaticProps() {
  const articles = await getAllArticles()

  articles
    .map((article) => article.data)
    .sort((a, b) => {
      if (a.data.publishedAt > b.data.publishedAt) return 1
      if (a.data.publishedAt < b.data.publishedAt) return -1

      return 0
    })

  return {
    props: {
      posts: articles.reverse(),
    },
  }
}
```
<br/>
The **getAllArticles** function is called in the **getStaticProps** data-fetching method to retrieve a sorted list of all the articles in the **data/articles** directory. 
The articles are sorted based on the date they were published, which we added to the **frontmatter** of each article using the **dayjs** package.
By mapping the returned list of articles to **props**, we can display the list of articles on the index (blog) page. 
Each article will have its own page and will be accessible via a unique slug generated by the **getSlug** function.
<br/>

```js
articles
  .map((article) => article.data)
  .sort((a, b) => {
    if (a.data.publishedAt > b.data.publishedAt) return 1
    if (a.data.publishedAt < b.data.publishedAt) return -1

    return 0
  })

```
<br/>
This is how the content of your typical article file will look in markdown syntax below:
<br/>

```js
---
title: "Copy.AI"
layout: "Article"
tags:
  -AI 
  -IT
  -UseFul Hack
  -Assistant
  -Writing
excerpt:
publishedAt:
---

```
<br/>
Indeed, sorting the list of articles by their published date is a better approach because it ensures that the articles are ordered correctly regardless of their order in the array. 
The **reverse()** method alone will only reverse the order of the articles in the array but not compare them based on their date.
Now that we have the sorted list of articles as props, we can map them onto the page to display them to the user. 
In the **index.js** file, we'll use the map method to loop through the articles array and return an ArticleCard component for each article.
The ArticleCard component will display the article's featured image, title, published date, and an excerpt of the article. 
We'll also use the slug from the article to link to the individual article page.
This way, the user can click on an article to read it in full on a separate page.
<br/>

```js
import React from 'react'
import Head from 'next/head'
import Link from "next/link"
import { getAllArticles } from '../../src/utils/mdx'

export default function BlogPage({ posts }) {
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <Head>
        <title>My Blog</title>
      </Head>
      <div>
        {posts.map((frontMatter) => {
          return (
            <Link href={`/blog/${frontMatter.slug}`} passHref>
              <div>
                <h1 className="title">{frontMatter.title}</h1>
                <p className="summary">{frontMatter.excerpt}</p>
                <p className="date">
                  {dayjs(frontMatter.publishedAt).format('MMMM D, YYYY')} &mdash;{' '}
                  {frontMatter.readingTime}
                </p>
              </div>
            </Link>
          )
        })}
      </div>
    </React.Fragment>
  )
}

export async function getStaticProps() {
  ...
}
```

<br/>
The **Link** component from **Next.js** allows us to create a hyperlink to a dynamic route with the article's slug as a parameter. 
This is made possible because we created a file called **[slug].js** earlier, which is a dynamic route that can accept a slug parameter. 
When the user clicks on the article link, they will be taken to the unique page with the slug parameter as part of the URL.
<br/>
<br/>

## Display a Unique Article
<br/>
In order to customize the look of our blog post, we'll be using rehype which is an HTML pre-processor powered by plugins. 
We'll need to install some of these plugins to accomplish our task.
We can install them by running the following command in our terminal:
<br/>
```js
npm install remark-rehype rehype-highlight rehype-autolink-headings
```
<br/>
The remark-rehype plugin is used to convert markdown to HTML which can then be processed by rehype. 
rehype-highlight is used to highlight code syntax in our blog posts and rehype-autolink-headings is used to add anchor tags to our headings, allowing users to easily navigate to specific sections of the article.
<br/>
In the snippet above, we have imported the necessary packages and functions we'll be using in this file. 
We have also exported a function called **getStaticPaths** that tells Next.js how many pages we have and what their respective paths are.
**getStaticPaths** function accepts no arguments, and returns an object with a paths property that takes an array of objects containing the params key.
The params key holds an object that has the slug key, and a fallback property that is either true or false.
In our case, the fallback property is set to false. 
This means that any path that is not in the paths array will return a **404 error**. 
If it is set to true, it means that any unknown path will trigger a **fallback**, and Next.js will generate the page on demand.
Please write in serious tone, instructive writing style, English language.
<br/>

```js
// dynamically generate the slugs for each article(s)
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  // getting all paths of each article as an array of
  // objects with their unique slugs
  const paths = (await getSlug()).map((slug) => ({ params: { slug } }))

  return {
    paths,
    // in situations where you try to access a path
    // that does not exist. it'll return a 404 page
    fallback: false,
  }
}
```
<br/>

When you take a look at the snippet above, you'll see that we're obtaining the **list of paths** from the articles, and mapping that list of items **(paths)** to an array.
This can be accessed with the **params** variable in the **getStaticProps** data-fetching method.

<br/>
```js
import { getArticleFromSlug } from "../../src/utils/mdx"

export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  //fetch the particular file based on the slug
  const { slug } = params
  const { content, frontmatter } = await getArticleFromSlug(slug)

  const mdxSource = await serialize(content, {
    mdxOptions: {
      rehypePlugins: [
        rehypeSlug,
        [
          rehypeAutolinkHeadings,
          {
            properties: { className: ['anchor'] },
          },
          { behaviour: 'wrap' },
        ],
        rehypeHighlight,
        rehypeCodeTitles,
      ],
    },
  })

  return {
    props: {
      post: {
        source: mdxSource,
        frontmatter,
      },
    },
  }
}`
```
<br/>
In the snippet above, we're destructuring content and **frontmatter** — which is the metadata of the article — and assigning it to the **getArticleFromSlug** function which receives the slug of the article as an argument.
We continued by serializing the content of the article with **next-mdx-remote**'s **serialize()** function, and pass the necessary **rehype plugins** in the mdxOptions object:
<br/>
```js
const mdxSource = await serialize(content, {
  mdxOptions: {
    rehypePlugins: [
      rehypeSlug,
      [
        rehypeAutolinkHeadings,
        {
          properties: { className: ['anchor'] },
        },
        { behaviour: 'wrap' },
      ],
      rehypeHighlight,
      rehypeCodeTitles,
    ],
  },
})
```
<br/>
To wrap it up, we return the content of the article and the frontmatter as props that'll be accessed by the slug component.
<br/>

```js
return {
  props: {
    post: {
      source: mdxSource,
      frontmatter,
    },
  },
}
```
<br/>

In the code snippet above, we're rendering the article content using the **MDXRemote** component, which receives the **source** and custom React component props.
The spread operator **source** helps to unpack the parsed markdown source into an MDX AST (Abstract Syntax Tree), which can then be transformed into React components that we can render on our webpage.
The custom React component props include the article's **frontmatter** data, which we can use to customize the layout of our article page.

<br/>

```js
import dayjs from 'dayjs'
import React from 'react'
import Head from 'next/head'
import Image from 'next/image'
import rehypeSlug from 'rehype-slug'
import { MDXRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote'
import rehypeHighlight from 'rehype-highlight'
import rehypeCodeTitles from 'rehype-code-titles'
import { serialize } from 'next-mdx-remote/serialize'
import 'highlight.js/styles/atom-one-dark-reasonable.css'
import rehypeAutolinkHeadings from 'rehype-autolink-headings'
import { getSlug, getArticleFromSlug } from '../../src/utils/mdx'
import { SectionTitle, Text } from '../../data/components/mdx-components'

export default function Blog({ post: { source, frontmatter } }) {
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <Head>
        <title>{frontmatter.title} | My blog</title>
      </Head>
      <div className="article-container">
        <h1 className="article-title">{frontmatter.title}</h1>
        <p className="publish-date">
          {dayjs(frontmatter.publishedAt).format('MMMM D, YYYY')} &mdash;{' '}
          {frontmatter.readingTime}
        </p>
        <div className="content">
          <MDXRemote {...source} components={{ Image, SectionTitle, Text }} />
        </div>
      </div>
    </React.Fragment>
  )
}
```
<br/>
In the snippet above, you'll notice how we destructured the post props into **source, frontmatter**. So instead of doing this, in the **MDXRemote** component below we can just spread the source variable directly as a prop.
<br/>
```js
<MDXRemote {...post.source} />
```
