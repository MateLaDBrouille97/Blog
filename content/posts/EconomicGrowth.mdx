The recent report from Goldman Sachs Global Economics Analyst shows that generative artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to significantly disrupt labor markets and boost global productivity growth. This type of AI is capable of generating human-like content and breaking down communication barriers between humans and machines. The report estimates that two-thirds of jobs in the US and Europe are at risk of AI automation, with generative AI potentially replacing up to a quarter of current work. The adoption of generative AI could lead to an increase of just under 1.5% in US labor productivity growth over a ten-year period, which could eventually translate to an annual global GDP growth of 7%.

The recent report from Goldman Sachs Global Economics Analyst shows that generative artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to significantly disrupt labor markets and boost global productivity growth. This type of AI is capable of generating human-like content and breaking down communication barriers between humans and machines. The report estimates that two-thirds of jobs in the US and Europe are at risk of AI automation, with generative AI potentially replacing up to a quarter of current work. The adoption of generative AI could lead to an increase of just under 1.5% in US labor productivity growth over a ten-year period, which could eventually translate to an annual global GDP growth of 7%.
<br />
However, it is important to note that worker displacement from automation has been historically offset by new job creation. Thus, predicting the timing of a productivity boom is difficult. The potential of generative AI lies in its ability to generate content that is virtually indistinguishable from human-created output and in breaking down communication barriers between humans and machines. If generative AI delivers on its promised capabilities, significant macroeconomic effects are expected.
<br />
Goldman Sachs utilized data on occupational tasks in both the US and Europe to suggest that generative AI could replace up to one-fourth of current work. Extrapolating the estimate globally suggests that approximately 300 million full-time jobs could be automated. Furthermore, the data suggests that fewer jobs in emerging markets are at risk of automation than in developed markets. Nevertheless, it is estimated that 18% of work worldwide is at risk of being automated, given that AI is not expected to impact the agricultural sector in emerging markets.
<br />
To arrive at their estimates, Goldman Sachs assumed that AI could automate tasks with a difficulty level of up to 4. This suggests that tasks such as web scraping, monitoring processes, evaluating information, updating and utilizing relevant knowledge, organizing and planning, documenting information, interpreting information for others, and performing administrative activities could be automated. These tasks are found in various industries, including retail, manufacturing, and healthcare, among others.
<br />
In summary, Goldman Sachs predicts that generative AI will have a significant impact on labor markets and productivity growth. It has the potential to substitute up to a quarter of current work. However, the timing of the productivity boom is uncertain, and it remains to be seen whether generative AI will indeed deliver on its promised capabilities.
