# What is Refind?
<br/>
Are you tired of scrolling through your social media feeds only to be bombarded with irrelevant content and clickbait articles? Look no further than Refind, the ultimate solution for anyone seeking a daily dose of informative reading.
<br/>

This app offers a Smart Daily Reading List that covers almost all major topics, from technology to journalism, marketing to start-ups. With its four sections -- Today, Reading List, Library, and Explore -- Refind has something for everyone. The Today section is curated based on your interests, providing you with hand-picked articles that are sure to keep you engaged. Meanwhile, the Reading List lets you access recently read articles and a wishlist of articles to read later. The Library keeps your bookmarked articles in one place, while the Explore section allows you to modify your profile, update your interests and preferences, and explore the settings of subscription services, product news, and much more.
<br/>
But Refind is more than just a place to read articles. With its intuitive design, you can customize your interests, create streaks, chat directly with the founder, invite friends, and much more. And if you want to take your reading to the next level, a premium membership can be purchased for USD 9.99 per month. This unlocks various premium content to sharpen your skills and learn new ones guided by experts.
<br/>
One of the coolest features of Refind is the ability to highlight text and save it as notes to remember the context. And if you're too busy to sit down and read, you can even listen to articles in audio form. Plus, with the option to share informative content with loved ones and refer friends to the app, you can spread the knowledge around.
<br/>
Of course, no app is perfect. Refind does contain in-app purchases and advertisements, but they're easy to navigate around, and most of the useful features can be accessed without purchasing the premium subscription.
<br/>
Overall, Refind is a great tool for anyone looking to stay informed and up-to-date on the latest news and trends. With its user-friendly interface and customizable features, it's no wonder why Refind has become a favorite among readers. So why not give it a try and see what all the fuss is about? You may just learn something new.
