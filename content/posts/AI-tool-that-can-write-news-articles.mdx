Google is reportedly testing an AI tool called "Genesis" that can write news stories and has approached publications like The New York Times, The Washington Post, and News Corp's The Wall Street Journal with the pitch. The tool aims to serve as a personal assistant for journalists by automating certain tasks and freeing up their time for other activities. Google views this tool as a form of "responsible technology," but some executives find it "unsettling" as it seemingly undermines the effort put into creating accurate news stories.
<br/>
Google clarified that the AI-enabled tools are meant to assist journalists, especially in smaller publications, by offering options for headlines and writing styles. The company emphasizes that these tools are not designed to replace the essential role of journalists in reporting, creating, and fact-checking articles.
<br/>
Several news organizations, including NPR and Insider, have expressed interest in exploring the responsible use of AI in their newsrooms. The Associated Press has already been using AI to generate stories for specific topics like corporate earnings, but it represents only a small portion of their overall articles, which are primarily written by journalists.
<br/>
The introduction of Google's new AI tool raises concerns about potential misinformation, as AI-generated articles that lack fact-checking and thorough editing could spread inaccuracies. CNET, an American media website, previously attempted AI-generated articles but faced issues with factual errors and plagiarism, leading to corrections and updates by staff writers. The move towards AI-generated news will likely prompt further discussions on maintaining journalistic integrity while leveraging AI technology in the news industry.

GitHub has unveiled Copilot Chat, an extension of its code completion tool, Copilot X. Initially available in private preview, it is now in a limited public beta for all GitHub business users on Visual Studio and VS Code. Copilot Chat integrates a code-centric chatbot directly into the integrated development environment (IDE), functioning as a context-aware conversational assistant. Developers can execute complex tasks using simple prompts, streamlining application building and code debugging. Unlike general-purpose generative AI chat assistants, Copilot Chat leverages GPT-4's power while being contextually aware of the code being worked on, enabling more precise and relevant assistance for developers, preserving their workflow.

In addition to answering coding questions and resolving errors and bugs, Copilot Chat assists with security issues and provides code analysis. The tool can also write unit tests using the Jest framework. The demand for Copilot Chat has been substantial, with businesses eager to access this new service. GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke notes the rapid adoption curve, indicating that companies are keen to sign up for the limited public beta without hesitation, reflecting the tool's value and potential for streamlining development processes. By offering Copilot Chat, GitHub aims to empower developers of all levels to build applications and tackle complex code challenges efficiently and effectively.
