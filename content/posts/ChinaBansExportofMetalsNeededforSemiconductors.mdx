China has implemented new export restrictions on the metals gallium and germanium, which are crucial for semiconductor manufacturing used in electric vehicles, displays, and defense equipment. The Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China stated that the move is aimed at safeguarding national security and interests. Under the new restrictions, exporters of these metals must apply for licenses that specify the buyer and the intended application or usage of the metals.
<br/>
This action by China is seen as a response to previous moves by the US and the EU to restrict China's access to advanced chips and reduce dependence on Chinese semiconductor manufacturing. In January, the US convinced the Netherlands and Japan to expand the ban on chip-making technology exports to China. Japan also imposed restrictions on chip exports to China, prompting China to urge Japan to repeal the restrictions.
<br/>
The ongoing chip trade war has led to increased efforts by the EU and Japan to strengthen their domestic chip industries. The EU recently formed a partnership with Japan to enhance cooperation on digital issues and invested billions of dollars in their semiconductor manufacturing capabilities. The European Council and Parliament agreed to invest $3.6 billion in EU funds to develop the bloc's semiconductor industry, with the aim of attracting $43.7 billion in private investment. Japan announced plans to invest $532 million in chip development projects, including a deal with Rapidus to produce 2nm chips in Japan by 2025.
<br/>
These developments highlight the intensifying competition and geopolitical tensions surrounding semiconductor manufacturing and its crucial role in various industries. Countries are taking measures to protect their own national interests and reduce dependence on others for critical technologies.

### ***US mulls new export restriction on computing power in AI chips***

U.S. officials are reportedly considering tightening an export control rule to restrict the flow of artificial intelligence (AI) chips to China. The rule would focus on limiting the computing power of the chips. This move is part of the Biden administration's efforts to curtail China's semiconductor industry while investing in the U.S. chip sector. The update to the rules may be announced in late July, but delays are possible. Nvidia, a major player in the AI chip market, warned that such restrictions would result in a permanent loss of opportunities for U.S. industry. The effectiveness of the existing rule in slowing China's AI development has been questioned.

### ***Chip wars: how semiconductors became a flashpoint in the US-China relationship***
<br/>
US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is heading to Beijing to address the escalating chip war between China and the US. The competition in advanced technology between the two superpowers continues unabated, despite diplomatic overtures. Beijing recently imposed export restrictions on two minerals essential for semiconductor production, a move seen as a hostile gesture ahead of Yellen's visit. The US administration is concerned about two issues: the possibility of China's People's Liberation Army surpassing the US military in overall power and China leveraging US technology to achieve this. China aims to develop autonomous weaponry and utilize artificial intelligence (AI) for various applications, including electronic warfare. While China excels in certain AI applications like facial recognition, it still relies on imports for advanced chips that power these technologies. The US has implemented export controls to limit China's access to US-origin semiconductors, curbing the purchase of advanced chips and chipmaking technology. The Netherlands and Japan were persuaded to restrict technology exports related to chip production, with the Dutch ASML being the sole provider of cutting-edge photolithography scanner equipment. China has retaliated by banning US-made chips from critical infrastructure projects and has sought alternative means to obtain top-end chips, including renting or purchasing through intermediaries and engaging in a black market for smuggled semiconductors. The US plans to close these loopholes and expand the restrictions, including limiting the leasing of cloud services. The trajectory of China-US relations in critical technology remains divergent, despite nominal efforts towards diplomatic reconciliation.

### ***U.S.-China Semiconductor War: How Does it Affect Crypto Mining?***

The article discusses the ongoing conflict between the United States and China, referred to as "The Semiconductor War," and its potential impact on the crypto mining and AI industries. The conflict arises from China's reliance on US semiconductor chips, which the US imposed export controls on. In response, China announced controls on the export of metals used in the semiconductor industry and banned chips made by a US company. The ban on crypto mining in China in 2021 led to a shift in mining operations to the US, but the export sanctions may affect the AI industry more significantly. The article highlights the potential consequences for the AI sector.
