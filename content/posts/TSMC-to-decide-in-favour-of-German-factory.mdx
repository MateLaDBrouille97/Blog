Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is reportedly set to build a new factory in the German city of Dresden. The decision is expected to be approved by TSMC's board of directors on Tuesday. The German government has committed to providing 5 billion euros in support for the construction of the facility.
<br/>
The German economy ministry and the government of Saxony, where Dresden is located, have not yet commented on the news. TSMC has been in discussions with Saxony since 2021 about establishing a fabrication plant in the region. The factory will be operated as a joint venture with partners Bosch, Infineon, and NXP, though these companies have declined to comment on the matter.
<br/>
After receiving approval from the board, TSMC is anticipated to sign a letter of intent with Berlin for the funding. The final decision will rest with the European Commission. Germany is planning to invest approximately 20 billion euros in the semiconductor industry in the upcoming years, following a broader trend among European governments to reduce reliance on Asian countries and enhance domestic semiconductor production by providing subsidies under the EU Chips Act.
<br/>
This move comes as the EU seeks to strengthen ties with Taiwan due to mounting diplomatic and military pressure from China. Furthermore, other semiconductor companies, including Intel and Infineon, are also investing in German facilities, benefiting from significant government subsidies.

# ***TikTok unveils new measures ahead of EU Digital Services Act***

<br />
Chinese-owned social media platform TikTok has announced a set of new features aimed at improving compliance with the European Union's Digital Services Act (DSA) for its European users. The DSA requires large online platforms, including TikTok's owner ByteDance and Google, to monitor and remove illegal content, prohibit certain advertising practices, and share data with authorities.
<br/>
Despite TikTok agreeing to a voluntary "stress test" last month, EU industry chief Thierry Breton noted that further efforts were needed for the platform to achieve full compliance. In response, TikTok is dedicating significant resources to meet regulatory requirements promptly.
<br/>
The newly revealed measures include making it easier for European users to report illegal content and giving them the option to disable personalized video recommendations. Additionally, targeted advertising for users aged 13 to 17 will be removed.
<br/>
TikTok aims not only to fulfill its regulatory obligations but also to set new standards through innovative solutions. By introducing these changes, the platform seeks to ensure a safer and more user-friendly experience for its European audience.

# ***Brazil central bank names its digital currency 'DREX,' scheduled for 2024 launch***
<br/>

<br />
The Central Bank of Brazil is planning to introduce a central bank digital currency (CBDC) by 2024, as announced by bank President Roberto Campos Neto during a conference hosted by Brazilian news site Poder360. Before launching the CBDC for wider use, the bank will conduct a pilot program in collaboration with select financial institutions. Campos Neto believes that this digitized, inclusive system will significantly contribute to the financial development and inclusion of people.
<br/>
In March, Brazil had chosen nine partners to assist in the development of the digital currency. Once the CBDC is issued, Brazil will join other countries like the Bahamas, Nigeria, Eastern Caribbean, and Jamaica, which have already implemented their own CBDCs. Many countries are exploring CBDC technology, and some are even more motivated to adopt it as a risk-free alternative to cryptocurrencies following the FTX crypto exchange's collapse, which caused disruptions in the industry.
<br/>
Campos Neto emphasized the benefits of the CBDC, including greater inclusion, lower costs, increased competition with reduced barriers to entry, improved risk control, data monetization, and complete tokenization of financial assets and contracts. Overall, the introduction of a CBDC is seen as a significant step towards embracing the digital economy in Brazil.

# ***Norway fines Facebook owner Meta over privacy breaches***
<br/>
<Image src="/tag_reuters.com,2023_newsml_LYNXMPEJ760N6_12023-08-07T191013Z_1_LYNXMPEJ760N6_RTROPTP_3_META-PLATFORMS-AI-CHATBOTS.jpg" alt="" width={600} height={500} />
<br />
Norway's data protection authority, Datatilsynet, has announced that it will fine Meta Platforms, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, 1 million Norwegian crowns ($98,500) per day for privacy breaches starting from August 14. The regulator had previously warned Meta that it would face fines if it did not address the privacy issues identified by the authority.
<br/>
The specific privacy breach concerns Meta's harvesting of user data in Norway, including physical locations, for the purpose of targeted advertising, known as behavioral advertising. The regulator has prohibited Meta from using such data for ad targeting in the country. Meta had until August 4 to demonstrate that it had resolved the issue, but it did not immediately respond to the request from Datatilsynet for clarification.
<br/>
The daily fine of 1 million crowns will be in effect until November 3. Datatilsynet has the authority to make the fine permanent and extend its scope to the rest of Europe by referring its decision to the European Data Protection Board, subject to agreement.
<br/>
In response to regulatory requirements in the European Union, Meta recently announced its intention to seek users' consent before allowing businesses to target advertising based on their activities on Facebook and Instagram. This move followed an order from Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner, Meta's lead EU regulator, to reassess the legal basis for ad targeting.
<br/>
Although Norway is not an EU member, it is part of the European single market, making the case relevant to the wider European context.

# ***India government delays licence mandate for import of laptops, tablets and PCs***
<br/>

<br />
India has announced a new licensing regime for the import of laptops, tablets, and personal computers, which will come into effect on November 1. The government has decided to provide a transition period before the new regime takes full effect. This move was met with surprise and prompted industry calls for a delay of three to six months.
<br/>
The decision to impose a licensing requirement for these imports aims to ensure trusted hardware and systems while also reducing the country's dependence on imports. The new policy could potentially impact major technology companies like Apple, Dell, and Samsung, leading them to consider boosting local manufacturing to comply with the regulations.
<br/>
The process for obtaining import licenses has been streamlined, with New Delhi planning to issue licenses within two days of application. Companies seeking licenses will have to provide relevant information, including the origin of the consignment, the number of items being imported, and past import history. The specific reasons for the sudden implementation of the licensing requirement were not disclosed in the government's initial notification.
<br/>
India's new licensing regime for laptops, tablets, and personal computers is set to begin on November 1, but a transition period will be provided to ease the transition. The policy is intended to enhance the trustworthiness of hardware and systems while encouraging local manufacturing and reducing reliance on imports.

# ***Palantir raises revenue target on AI boost, announces share buyback***
<br/>

<br />
Palantir Technologies, a prominent AI platform provider, has raised its annual revenue forecast and announced a share buyback program worth up to $1 billion. The company's CEO, Alexander Karp, revealed that the AI platform, launched in April, has gained traction across more than 100 organizations, including healthcare and automotive industries. Moreover, Palantir is in discussions with over 300 additional companies to adopt its platform. The AI platform includes an AI assistant that assists enterprises in making informed decisions about their operations.
<br/>
The company's shares have experienced significant growth, nearly tripling in value this year, in line with other AI-related stocks like C3.ai. Following the announcement of an expected full-year revenue above $2.21 billion (previously forecasted in the range of $2.19 billion to $2.24 billion), Palantir's shares initially dipped by 10%, disappointing some investors. However, the stock recovered after the share buyback program was revealed, which is seen as a significant move for a company of Palantir's size.
<br/>
In the second quarter, Palantir's revenue increased by 13% to $533.3 million, slightly surpassing estimates. Both government and commercial revenue growth rates slowed to 15% and 10%, respectively. The CFO, David Glazer, acknowledged that demand in Europe was subdued, and commercial revenue was impacted by investments in special purpose acquisition companies. Looking ahead, Palantir expects increased expenses in the third quarter due to the expansion of its AI platform and hiring efforts to attract new technical talent.
