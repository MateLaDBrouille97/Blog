It has been reported that the US-based news site CNET has laid off 12 employees and replaced them with AI content created by ChatGPT.
This move is part of a new editorial strategy that aims to have AI produce explanatory finance articles on a daily basis. 
CNET's editor-in-chief, Connie Guglielmo, has been reassigned to the position of senior vice-president of AI content strategy.
While ChatGPT's ability to produce editorial content demonstrates the growing capabilities of AI in the media industry, it also raises concerns about the potential threat to traditional journalism and the possibility of decreased employment opportunities in the media sector.
The layoffs were announced via email by Red Ventures, the private equity-backed marketing-turned-media company that acquired CNET last year. A Red Ventures executive suggested that the cuts were made to focus CNET on areas where the site can succeed in generating traffic on Google search. 
CNET will focus on "authority," a metric considered by Google in search rankings, and will continue its coverage of consumer technology, home and wellness, energy, broadband, and personal finance. The site is also planning to deploy AI-generated content again soon.
