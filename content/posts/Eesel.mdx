Eesel is a Google Chrome extension designed to enhance productivity and workflow for those who work extensively online. It aims to consolidate all online work and resources in one place, streamlining the process of switching between various websites, documents, and tools.
<br/>
What sets eesel apart is its ability to work with diverse types of internet content, including documents, company platforms, websites, and custom tools. The extension achieves this by importing your work from the browser's history, ensuring that all data stays on your computer and doesn't raise security concerns.
<br/>
Eesel operates with remarkable simplicity and efficiency, allowing users to declutter their workspace. Instead of having numerous pinned tabs, the extension organizes and categorizes your important documents and resources. Moreover, it offers a robust search function that enables you to find documents based on both their titles and content.
<br/>
Though initially requiring some adjustment, eesel proves to be easy to use after installation. A simple shortcut (CTRL+SHIFT+E) allows quick access to the extension, making the retrieval of necessary documents or online resources seamless.
<br/>
Eesel presents a compelling proposition for individuals seeking to centralize and access their online resources efficiently. Its ease of use, low resource consumption, unobtrusiveness, and local data handling make it an attractive option for improving productivity in the digital workspace.
