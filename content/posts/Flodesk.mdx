# What is Flodesk ?
<br/>

Flodesk is a new email marketing platform founded by Martha Bitar and Rebecca Shostak in 2019 that helps businesses create beautifully designed emails and automations with ease. 
It offers a library of beautiful email templates that are easy to customize, so businesses can create stunning emails without any design experience. 
Flodesk's key features include an email builder, templates, workflow automations, forms, and segments. 
Its workflow feature is perfect for automating email marketing, as it allows businesses to send targeted content to specific groups of people, and its forms feature makes it easy to add sign-up or opt-in forms to websites or blogs. 
Flodesk also has a segments feature that allows businesses to segment subscribers so they can send targeted hyper-personalized content. 
However, Flodesk's feature set is not as comprehensive as some of the other tools on the market because it is still a relatively new email marketing tool. 
Despite this, Flodesk's features should meet the needs of most small businesses and entrepreneurs.
