Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent visits to the US and France have focused on bolstering strategic and economic cooperation in the technology sector. Amidst global political and economic instability, these engagements emphasized the significance of technology in geopolitical alignments and emerging economic opportunities.
<br/>
During the visits, two key areas of cooperation stood out: defense technology and digital technology. In defense technology, partnerships expanded to include military aviation and naval capabilities. Agreements were made for the manufacturing of jet engines and the procurement of unmanned aerial vehicles, strengthening India's defense capabilities.
<br/>
In the digital technology sector, discussions revolved around cyber security, artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing (QC), semiconductors, and high-performance computing (HPC). Collaborations were established to foster cooperation in building semiconductor capabilities, developing AI and QC systems, and setting standards for global cooperation. India's leadership in the Global Partnership for AI (GPAI) was acknowledged, and a joint Indo-US Quantum Coordination Mechanism was formed to facilitate collaboration among industry, academia, and government in the field of quantum computing.
<br/>
Additionally, cybersecurity cooperation, protection of critical infrastructure, and promoting cybersecurity education were key aspects of the partnerships. Both the US and France showed support for India's Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) initiative, aimed at reducing the global digital divide.
<br/>
The convergence of defense technology and digital technology is seen as a force multiplier, transforming defense capabilities through the integration of digital technologies. The timing and approach are favorable for India to capitalize on these partnerships and lead in technological advancements. However, building more capacity on the ground will be crucial for enabling successful outcomes.

# ***Dutch online marketplace OLX contributing to EU antitrust probe into Meta***
<br/>

<br />
Dutch online marketplace, OLX, has announced its collaboration with EU antitrust regulators in the ongoing investigation into Meta Platforms, the owner of Facebook. The European Commission has accused Meta of engaging in anti-competitive practices, alleging that it unfairly linked its classified ads service, Marketplace, with its social media platform and imposed unfavorable trading conditions on rival online classified ads services. In response, Meta has contested the charges, asserting that the case lacks a solid foundation.
<br/>
OLX's involvement in the investigation aims to provide valuable insights to the EU's antitrust enforcers. The company has expressed its commitment to supporting fair competition and is keenly observing the progress of the Commission's hearing into Meta's alleged antitrust practices. As a subsidiary of South African technology investor Naspers, OLX's cooperation in the probe adds weight to the regulatory scrutiny surrounding Meta's practices.
<br/>
In addition to OLX, Norwegian media group Schibsted also participated in the EU hearing as part of the investigation. The collaboration of these prominent companies underscores the significance of the case and the potential implications for competition within the online marketplace sector. As the investigation continues, the European Commission will likely weigh the evidence presented by OLX and other parties to determine whether Meta has indeed violated antitrust regulations.
