EU legislators have voted to increase the European Union's share of renewable energy to over 40% by 2030 while streamlining permitting processes. The European Parliament's decision to raise the renewable power target from 30% to 42.5% aligns with global efforts to promote clean energy. However, the move comes as European solar and wind power industries face potential insolvency due to intense competition from Chinese companies benefiting from subsidies and cheap labor.
<br/>
The EU's new renewable energy goal was only achieved after last-minute concessions, particularly concerning nuclear power, which is low carbon but generates radioactive waste. Despite opposition from some right-wing politicians and abstentions by some French lawmakers, nearly three-quarters of legislators supported the rules. The legislation also aims to expedite the approval of renewable projects, allowing them to be recognized as having public interest and simplifying permitting.
<br/>
Kadri Simson, the EU's energy commissioner, believes the upgraded target will attract the massive investments needed for renewable deployment. Around 130 GW of renewable energy projects await approval in the EU. Meanwhile, the G20 leaders agreed to triple renewable energy capacity by 2030, though they failed to set a timeline for phasing out fossil fuels.
<br/>
While the EU seeks to position itself as a leader in environmental regulations through its Green Deal climate law, it faces challenges in competing with China and the US, which offer substantial subsidies for clean technology. Critics argue that the EU's renewables law is controversial for allowing biomass burning and call for revising the rules to exclude tax benefits or support for biomass use in heating and power generation.

# ***Water worries hit the chip sector***
<br/>
The UN's Africa Climate Week has commenced in Nairobi, with Kenyan President William Ruto among the prominent speakers. However, this event occurs during a challenging period for sustainable finance on the continent. Gabon recently experienced a presidential coup, jeopardizing its $500 million debt-for-nature swap, a deal aimed at preserving its lush forests, home to gorillas and elephants. The country's dollar-denominated bonds plummeted following the coup, potentially affecting sustainable bonds across Africa, as noted by BNP Paribas.
<br/>
Meanwhile, the semiconductor industry faces escalating water scarcity risks. High demand for chips, combined with climate change-induced droughts in key regions, threatens water-intensive manufacturing processes. Taiwan, a significant hub for semiconductor production, suffered severe water shortages, further exposing the industry's vulnerability.
<br/>
Investors are now awakening to these supply chain challenges driven by climate change. Morgan Stanley warned that shareholders in semiconductor firms may not fully appreciate the long-term impacts of water scarcity, particularly in water-stressed areas like Taiwan. Some companies are beginning to address these issues, with Intel nearly achieving water-neutrality through recycling efforts.
<br/>
However, water problems could intensify with the rapid growth of artificial intelligence, which also demands substantial water resources. The lack of transparency in disclosing water efficiency information, especially when compared to carbon emissions, remains a concern, highlighting the need for more comprehensive sustainability efforts within the tech industry.
<br/>
In summary, Africa Climate Week faces difficulties due to political instability, while the semiconductor industry grapples with water scarcity risks exacerbated by climate change and AI development, emphasizing the pressing need for sustainable practices and transparency in these sectors.

# ***EU moves against China’s electric-car makers in bid to shield own industry***
<br/>
The European Union (EU) has initiated an anti-subsidy investigation into China's electric car industry in a bid to protect European manufacturers from being overshadowed by Chinese competitors. Although Chinese electric vehicle imports constitute a small portion of the EU market, their rapid growth could reach 15% within two years, mirroring the solar panel scenario from a decade ago.
<br/>
The EU is taking this action to safeguard its car industry as it plans to ban the sale of new combustion engine vehicles by 2035 to reduce carbon emissions. Concerns arise that China might dominate the production of electric vehicle replacements, rather than Europe. Chinese subsidies have already allowed their imports to undercut European electric vehicle prices by about 20%.
<br/>
The investigation, expected to last nine months, could result in tariffs of around 10-15% if it finds harm to domestic producers. However, these measures won't cover imported batteries, which pose a significant challenge.
<br/>
European automakers face competition not only from cheaper Chinese electric vehicles but also rely on batteries produced by Chinese companies. Tariffs may not effectively counter this issue due to Chinese-owned battery plants in Europe and existing integration of Chinese batteries in European car models.
<br/>
The EU's automotive industry plays a pivotal role, employing nearly 13 million people and contributing 7% to the bloc's economy. This investigation reflects growing concerns about EU manufacturers' competitiveness in the electric vehicle market and signals a significant trade dispute with China amid broader geopolitical tensions. However, the outcome may be influenced by member states' economic interests and potential retaliatory actions from China.

# ***Electric vehicle uptake faces major obstacles, despite rosy projections***
<br/>
The article discusses two significant developments in the realm of sustainable technology and climate-related risks. Firstly, it highlights a historic strike by the largest US car workers' union against major Detroit carmakers, drawing attention to the potential job disruption caused by the transition to cleaner energy sources. With internal combustion engine workers at risk of redundancy, concerns about undermining organized labor through battery joint ventures with non-unionized companies are raised.
<br/>
Secondly, the article focuses on the exponential growth of electric vehicles (EVs) in the global economy. Research suggests that EV sales could comprise 62-86% of all auto sales by 2030 if they continue to accelerate. However, caution is advised, as challenges like charging infrastructure, subsidies in markets like China, and supply chain issues remain. The positive impact on the environment, with reduced greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles, is highlighted as governments worldwide subsidize EV costs and invest in charging infrastructure.
<br/>
Additionally, the article discusses research indicating that extreme weather in Asian apparel hubs could lead to substantial economic losses, including a potential $65 billion decline in export earnings and the loss of 1 million jobs between 2025 and 2030. The study underscores the importance of climate adaptation measures such as cooling systems and flood barriers, which have often been overlooked by the fashion industry.
<br/>
The article emphasizes the complexities and challenges associated with the transition to sustainable technologies, including EVs, while also shedding light on the economic risks posed by climate change in vulnerable industries like apparel manufacturing.
