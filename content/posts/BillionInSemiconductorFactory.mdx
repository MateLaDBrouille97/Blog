France is investing €2.9 billion ($3.1 billion) in a microchip factory, intensifying the global competition for this lucrative market. The move comes as Europe and the United States have enacted "Chips Acts" to bolster investment in the sector and mitigate concerns about China's dominance in the global supply chain. The funding will support a joint project between STMicroelectronics and GlobalFoundries, with the goal of increasing European chip production capacity by almost six percent by 2028. The pandemic's impact on chip supply chains has heightened the race to secure semiconductor supplies, and the US Chips Act has drawn criticism from Beijing for being protectionist.
