The United States has expanded its export restrictions on AI chips, now targeting the Middle East, following similar measures applied to China. Both Nvidia and AMD chips, commonly used in machine learning, will be affected by the new policy. Although Nvidia believes the move won't have an immediate impact, the specific Middle Eastern countries impacted by these restrictions are not detailed in the report.
<br/>
Nvidia's A100 and H100 processors, pivotal in AI applications, are subject to the ban. This measure has been previously enacted against Russia and China, driven by concerns over these countries' intentions, particularly in military applications of AI. The US-China tech war has amplified trade restrictions, with the Biden administration aiming to curb China's AI progress by limiting its access to advanced chips.
<br/>
US officials had previously informed Nvidia of the restrictions targeted at China, recognizing that controlling chip exports would hinder China's ambitions to develop its own processors. This strategy forced China to seek local alternatives for chip production, prompting potential chipmaking markets like Vietnam and India to emerge. These countries could become alternatives to China due to their relative immunity from US export policies.
<br/>
Despite these measures, experts point out that China's ability to build its own chips might undermine the effectiveness of the restrictions. Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, highlighted the potential damage to the tech industry caused by such limitations, emphasizing China's significance as a technology market. As geopolitical tensions persist, the US must carefully consider the repercussions of its actions on the global technology landscape.
<br/>
In conclusion, the US has extended export restrictions on AI chips to the Middle East, impacting Nvidia and AMD processors. The ban, previously imposed on China and Russia, highlights concerns over military applications of AI. While the immediate effects might be limited, the move underscores the intricate interplay of geopolitics and technology trade.

# ***More US Chip Curbs to China Could Damage More Chipmaking Businesses, Nvidia Says***

<br />
Nvidia, a California-based hardware company, has issued a warning about the potential long-term negative consequences of the ongoing AI chip export curbs imposed by the US on China. The company asserts that these restrictions could lead to a "permanent loss" for American semiconductor firms. The Biden administration has considered implementing additional changes in line with AI-related chip restrictions, which could impact Nvidia's business model.
<br/>
Nvidia had begun selling H100 and A100 GPUs to China in 2022, products that had complied with US export control regulations. While the company stated that the existing regulations are achieving their intended results and that additional export restrictions might not immediately affect their financial results, Nvidia's CFO Colette Kress emphasized that banning the sale of graphics processing units to China could result in a lasting loss of opportunities for the US industry.
<br/>
Despite the US chip curbs limiting China's access to advanced hardware for AI applications, Nvidia's revenue exceeded expectations in the current quarter, driven by strong demand for its semiconductors tailored for AI processes. The company's fiscal third

# ***China Green Lights Rollout of AI Chatbots as It Enters Global AI Race***
<br/>
China has granted approval for its major technology companies, including Baidu and SenseTime, to offer AI-powered chatbots similar to OpenAI's ChatGPT to the general public. This move reflects China's ambition to expand the usage of AI technologies and services, aiming to compete internationally, particularly with the United States. Baidu, the leading Chinese search engine, introduced its alternative to ChatGPT, called Ernie Bot, which gained popularity upon its release. SenseTime Group also launched its chatbot, SenseChat, to the public, along with two other AI companies, Zhipu AI and Baichuan Intelligent Technology, making their chatbot services accessible. Unlike many countries, China requires businesses to undergo security evaluations and receive government authorization before launching mass-market AI products. This demonstrates China's commitment to nurturing AI development for global competitiveness.
<br/>
China's strategy emphasizes indigenous technology creation, focusing on AI despite its tight control over the technology environment. The "interim regulation" for controlling generative AI services came into effect on August 15, with a more flexible approach allowing AI technology firms to develop without stringent regulations until products are available to the general public. Alibaba Cloud's AI model, Tongyi Qianwen, has been completed but is awaiting formal introduction and clearance from authorities.
<br/>
China's competitive internet market underscores the importance of gaining a first-mover advantage. Baidu's Ernie Bot quickly gained traction, ranking highly in the free software category in China's Apple App Store. Companies that receive clearance have an advantage, as they can refine their products more swiftly. Baidu's CEO, Robin Li, described the new regulations as "pro-innovation" and hoped for a supportive legislative climate for innovation. While China advances AI, OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, supported by Microsoft, is predicted to earn over $1 billion in revenue the following year.

# ***North Korean Hackers Deploy New Malicious Python Packages in PyPI Repository***
<br/>
In an ongoing malicious software supply chain campaign known as VMConnect, three rogue Python packages were discovered in the Package Index (PyPI) repository, and there are indications of North Korean state-sponsored threat actors' involvement. ReversingLabs identified the malicious packages as tablediter, request-plus, and requestspro. VMConnect involves Python packages that mimic popular open-source Python tools to download a second-stage malware.
<br/>
The malicious actors employ typosquatting techniques to impersonate legitimate packages, such as prettytable and requests, to deceive developers into using their packages. The tablediter package runs a remote server in an endless execution loop, periodically fetching and executing an encoded payload. The payload's exact nature remains unknown. Notably, it no longer triggers malicious code immediately upon installation to evade security software detection.
<br/>
The request-plus and requestspro packages collect information about infected machines and transmit it to a command-and-control (C2) server. The C2 server responds with a token, initiating a complex process ultimately resulting in the download of additional malware.
<br/>
The use of a token-based approach mirrors a previously discovered npm campaign associated with North Korean actors. This connection raises the possibility of a common tactic used by these adversaries to deliver second-stage malware selectively.
<br/>
Infrastructure overlaps between the npm campaign and the JumpCloud hack further support the links to North Korea. Additionally, a Python package named py_QRcode exhibits similar malicious functionality to VMConnect and was used in a separate attack chain targeting cryptocurrency exchange developers in May 2023.
<br/>
Notably, these attacks also targeted macOS systems and deployed a novel backdoor called JokerSpy. Another malware, QRLog, with identical functionality as py_QRcode, was detailed in June 2023 and links to the Lazarus Group, specifically a sub-cluster known as Labyrinth Chollima.
<br/>
These findings underscore the continued use of the PyPI repository as a distribution point for malware by threat actors. The campaign's complexity and adaptability highlight the need for enhanced cybersecurity measures to protect the software supply chain and developers.
