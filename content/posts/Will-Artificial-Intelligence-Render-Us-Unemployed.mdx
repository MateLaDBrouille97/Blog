Artificial Intelligence (AI) has raised concerns regarding its impact on employment, with alarming signs like the first wave of AI-related layoffs in France. However, rather than fearing job losses, we must examine how AI can transform the world of work. The current debate revolves around whether AI will be our competitor or ally.
<br/>
While some dread a machine takeover of human roles, others envision a future where AI becomes our valuable collaborator, freeing humanity from repetitive tasks to focus on creativity and innovation. The panel of debaters includes experts with diverse perspectives, from a social media-specialized entrepreneur to a philosopher of work.
<br/>
Laurent DAUDET, CEO of LightOn, shares his experience and explores the ethical challenges posed by AI. Apolline GUILLOT, Editor-in-Chief of Philonomist, provides a philosophical perspective on technology. Alexandre VIROS, President of Adecco Group France, discusses AI's opportunities in the employment sector. Fabrice EPELBOIN, a lecturer at Sciences Po, examines the implications of social networks in this context. Lastly, Julia DE FUNES, a philosopher of work, offers an in-depth reflection on the evolution of human-machine relationships.
<br/>
This debate underscores the importance of understanding AI not just as a threat but also as a transformative force, encouraging us to consider how we can collaborate with it to shape a more fulfilling future of work.
