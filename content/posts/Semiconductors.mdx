<br/>
Semiconductors are essential components of modern electronic devices and are predominantly manufactured in Taiwan. Concerns about the overreliance on Taiwan, particularly due to the strained relationship between Taiwan and China, prompted the U.S. Congress to pass the CHIPS and Science Act in July 2022. This act provides over $50 billion in subsidies to bolster semiconductor production in the United States. Electrical engineer Trevor Thornton explains the basics of semiconductors and their manufacturing process.

<br/>
Semiconductor chips are made from thin silicon slices called wafers, on which complex components are arranged in specific patterns. These patterns utilize electrical switches called transistors to control the flow of current, akin to flipping a switch to control the electricity in a home. Unlike mechanical switches, semiconductor switches are entirely electrical, and a single chip can contain billions of switches within a small area.

<br/>
Semiconductors play a crucial role in processing, storing, and receiving information in electronic devices. Memory chips store data, digital chips manipulate data based on software instructions, and wireless chips convert radio signals into electrical signals. The interaction of different chips is coordinated by software.
<br/>
To build a semiconductor chip, manufacturers start with a silicon wafer, which is then layered with elements like phosphorus and boron to enhance conductivity. Transistors are constructed by adding layers of conductive metals, insulators, and silicon, followed by lithography to sketch patterns and selective removal of layers to create desired structures. By repeating this process multiple times, manufacturers can create chips with billions of transistors per square inch.
<br/>
The advancement of semiconductor chips has been characterized by the increase in the number of transistors per chip. Early chips contained a few thousand transistors, while modern chips can have over 50 billion transistors. This progress aligns with Moore's law, which states that the number of transistors on a chip roughly doubles every 18 months. The industry has overcome challenges by transitioning from two-dimensional to three-dimensional layering, enabling higher transistor counts.

<br/>
As chips become more complex, the factories required for manufacturing them also become more intricate and costly. Instead of building their own factories, most semiconductor companies now rely on independent foundries. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and GlobalFoundries are examples of multinational foundries that specialize in manufacturing chips for other companies. The United States, despite being the birthplace of the transistor and semiconductor chip, does not currently have state-of-the-art semiconductor foundries. However, the CHIPS act aims to incentivize and create opportunities for next-generation semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S.
