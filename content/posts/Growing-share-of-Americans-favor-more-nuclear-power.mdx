According to a recent survey by the Pew Research Center, the majority of Americans now support the expansion of nuclear power in the United States. The survey, conducted in 2023, found that 57% of Americans favor more nuclear power plants, an increase from 43% in 2020. However, Americans still have a stronger preference for solar power (82%) and wind power (75%) over nuclear power. Supporters of nuclear power argue that it could play a crucial role in reducing carbon emissions from electricity generation. On the other hand, critics highlight the high cost of nuclear power plants and the complexities of handling radioactive waste. 
<br/>
The survey also found that support for nuclear power has increased among both Democrats and Republicans since 2020. Half of Democrats now favor expanding nuclear power, compared to 37% in 2020. Two-thirds of Republicans now support more nuclear power, up 14 percentage points from 2020. 
<br/>
In terms of gender differences, men are more likely than women to support nuclear power and believe that the federal government should encourage its production. Similarly, globally, men are more likely than women to favor using more nuclear power as a source of domestic energy. 
<br/>
The United States currently has 93 operational nuclear power reactors, which generated 18.2% of all U.S. electricity in 2022. The number of reactors has declined since peaking at 111 in 1990. The oldest operational reactor in the U.S. is Nine Mile Point-1, which began operations in 1969. Perceived dangers following nuclear accidents, such as the Fukushima Daiichi accident in 2011, have contributed to the decline of nuclear power projects in recent years.
<br/>
Overall, while support for nuclear power is increasing in the United States, solar and wind power remain more popular options for Americans.

# ***Majorities of Americans Prioritize Renewable Energy, Back Steps to Address Climate Change***
<br/>
A recent Pew Research Center survey shows that while most Americans support taking action to address climate change and prioritize renewable energy sources, there is still resistance to making sweeping changes to cut carbon emissions. The survey of 10,329 U.S. adults conducted in May and June 2023 found that 74% of Americans support the country's participation in international efforts to reduce the effects of climate change, and 67% prioritize the development of alternative energy sources over increasing fossil fuel energy production. 
<br/>
However, there is limited support for phasing out the use of fossil fuels altogether, with only 31% of Americans in favor of this. Additionally, less than half of the public supports phasing out gas-powered vehicles and requiring new buildings to run only on electricity. 
<br/>
The survey also highlights the partisan divide on climate and energy issues, with deep Republican skepticism towards renewable energy transition and a prioritization of oil, coal, and natural gas production. Republicans express concerns about the cost of transitioning to renewable energy and oppose phasing out gas-powered vehicles. 
<br/>
On the other hand, Democrats overwhelmingly support the U.S. participating in international efforts to address climate change and prioritize renewable energy sources. However, there are differences within the Democratic coalition, with liberals more likely to support phasing out fossil fuels altogether and ending the production of gas-powered vehicles. 
<br/>
There is also public support for government action in helping communities at high risk of extreme weather events and addressing environmental disparities across communities. Overall, the survey shows that while there is widespread support for climate action and renewable energy, there are still barriers to making significant changes and a need for further education and policy development.

# ***What the data says about Americansâ€™ views of climate change***
<br/>
Recent surveys conducted by the Pew Research Center provide insight into American attitudes towards climate change and the steps they believe should be taken to address it. The surveys show that a majority of Americans support prioritizing the development of renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, over expanding the production of oil, coal, and natural gas. This sentiment is particularly strong among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, with 90% supporting the development of alternative energy sources.
<br/>
While Americans are generally reluctant to phase out fossil fuels altogether, younger adults are more open to this idea. Among Americans ages 18 to 29, nearly half believe the U.S. should exclusively use renewables, compared to 52% who believe a mix of energy sources should be used.
<br/>
The surveys also indicate that Americans believe multiple actors, including large businesses and corporations, state elected officials, and the energy industry, are not doing enough to address the impacts of climate change. Additionally, a majority of Americans support federal incentives to encourage domestic production of wind and solar power, but views are mixed on other activities that would reduce carbon emissions.
<br/>
There are notable differences in attitudes towards climate change based on political affiliation. Democrats are more likely than Republicans to view climate change as a major threat and prioritize addressing it as a top issue. Republicans are more divided, with only 23% considering climate change a major threat. Views also vary within political parties by age and ideology.
<br/>
Overall, the surveys highlight the need for international action and greater efforts by various stakeholders to address climate change, as well as the importance of understanding and bridging the partisan divide on the issue.
