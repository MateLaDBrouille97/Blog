<br />
The infographic provided showcases the production of lithium by different countries from 1995 to 2021. In the 1990s, the United States was the largest producer of lithium, accounting for over one-third of global production in 1995. However, Chile took over as the biggest producer from 1995 to 2010 due to a production boom in the Salar de Atacama, a lithium-rich brine deposit. By 2021, Australia became the largest producer, accounting for 52% of the world's lithium production. Unlike Chile, Australia extracts lithium from hard-rock mines.
<br/>
China is the third-largest producer of lithium and has a strong foothold in the lithium supply chain. Chinese companies have acquired significant lithium assets in countries like Chile, Canada, and Australia in the past decade. China also hosts 60% of the world's lithium refining capacity for batteries.
<br/>
Lithium consumption has significantly shifted over time. In 2010, ceramics and glass accounted for the largest share of lithium consumption at 31%. However, by 2021, the demand for lithium in batteries had surged, accounting for 74% of consumption. Other uses of lithium include ceramics and glass, lubricating greases, air treatment, and continuous casting.
<br/>
The future of lithium production is closely tied to the increasing demand for batteries and electric vehicles. By 2025, the demand for lithium is projected to reach 1.5 million tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE), and by 2030, it is expected to exceed 3 million tonnes. However, it can take several years for new lithium projects to come online, leading to projections of a deficit in the lithium market in the coming years. To meet the growing demand, lithium production needs to triple by 2025 and increase almost six-fold by 2030.
