Chinese President Xi Jinping met with Bill Gates in Beijing to discuss the global rise of artificial intelligence (AI). Xi expressed his support for U.S. companies, including Microsoft, bringing their AI technology to China. The meeting also covered Microsoft's business development in China. The details of their discussion on AI were not disclosed in reports or Gates' post about the trip. This meeting takes place during a period of strained U.S.-China relations, with AI being a contentious issue. Microsoft, a supporter of OpenAI, has been operating in China for over 30 years but has faced challenges due to increased control over the internet sector in the country.
