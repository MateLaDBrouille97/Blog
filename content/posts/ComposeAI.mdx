# What is Compose.AI ?
<br/>
Compose AI is an autocomplete tool that learns the user's common phrases and writing style to recommend the best verbiage as they type.
The tool can be used in various communication tools such as email, Slack, and productivity tools like Notion and Coda, as well as long text creation platforms like essays and blogs.
Compose AI is contextually aware and provides suggestions tailored to the specific writing style of the user, whether they are drafting a quick message or laboring over a long essay.
The tool is also personalized to the user's voice and is aware of the setting and context in which the writing is taking place.
Compose AI improves over time as it learns more about the user's writing style and preferences.
