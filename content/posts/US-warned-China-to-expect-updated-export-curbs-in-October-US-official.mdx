The Biden administration has informed Beijing of its intention to update regulations restricting the export of AI chips and chipmaking tools to China in early October, according to a U.S. official. The move is part of an effort to stabilize relations between the United States and China. The Commerce Department, responsible for export controls, is working on an update to the existing restrictions, aiming to align them with new Dutch and Japanese rules while closing some loopholes in export restrictions on AI chips.
<br/>
This advance notice to China is part of a broader strategy to mend relations between the two nations. The Biden administration has recently taken steps like shooting down a Chinese spy balloon and sending high-level officials to China, including Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. The export restrictions, initially released in October 2022, were designed to prevent the use of U.S. technology to bolster the Chinese military by restricting access to advanced AI chips and advanced chipmaking tools.
<br/>
While the Department of Commerce declined to comment, the Chinese embassy in Washington offered no specific response. A Chinese spokesperson criticized the U.S. for abusing export control measures. The Biden administration is keen on securing Chinese President Xi Jinping's attendance at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in San Francisco in November, which has influenced the timing of the new export rules' release.
<br/>
Despite the intention to announce the rules near the one-year anniversary, technical work remains incomplete, and final plans are not yet in place. The regulations may have an impact on companies like ASML, the world's leading chip equipment maker based in the Netherlands, as their systems incorporate U.S. components. It's worth noting that U.S. proposals often undergo modifications before becoming regulations, so both the content and timing of these restrictions could change.

# ***EU to assess risks of critical technologies being weaponised***
<br/>
The European Commission is set to evaluate the potential risks associated with four crucial technologies: semiconductors, artificial intelligence, quantum technologies, and biotechnologies like vaccines and genome sequencing. Concerned about these technologies being weaponized by nations not aligned with European values, the EU plans to implement measures in the coming year to address this issue. Possible actions include export controls and collaboration with like-minded partners. This move aligns with the EU's economic security strategy announced earlier and follows similar actions taken by the United States, Australia, and others concerned about China's growing influence. The EU aims to reduce dependency on foreign sources for key products due to recent supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic and the Ukraine conflict.

# ***EU examines Nvidia-dominated AI chip market's alleged abuses, Bloomberg reports***
<br/>
The European Union is investigating potential anticompetitive behavior in the artificial intelligence chip market, primarily dominated by Nvidia. The European Commission has been gathering input informally regarding alleged abusive practices in the graphics processing units (GPU) sector, which are vital for both AI and gaming applications. While this preliminary inquiry may not lead to a formal investigation or sanctions, it reflects concerns about Nvidia's near-monopoly, with an 80% market share in GPUs. French authorities are also scrutinizing Nvidia's role in AI chips, pricing policies, chip shortages, and their impact on prices. Nvidia's prominence surged, especially with the success of generative AI chatbot ChatGPT.

# ***Samsung poses threat to Taiwan’s ‘silicon shield’***
<br/>
Taiwan's position as a critical player in the global semiconductor supply chain, with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) at its core, is facing a significant challenge from South Korean giant Samsung Electronics. Analysts predict that Samsung could potentially surpass TSMC as the world's largest and highest-valued semiconductor producer. While TSMC currently holds a dominant 58% global market share in semiconductors, Samsung, though lagging behind in technology, boasts more resources.
<br/>
Semiconductors, often referred to as the "oil of the modern economy," play a crucial role in various technologies, including electric vehicles and smartphones. Their importance is growing as the world transitions to green energy.
<br/>
If Samsung were to outpace TSMC, it could jeopardize Taiwan's strategic advantage in the semiconductor industry, which serves as a protective shield against Chinese aggression. The West's interests in maintaining Taiwan's independence could waver, shifting the geopolitical landscape in the region.
<br/>
Samsung's goal to overtake TSMC by 2028, despite acknowledging a technological gap of a year or two, raises concerns. However, they anticipate taking the lead in the race for two-nanometer technology within five years.
<br/>
As of the second quarter of 2023, Samsung's semiconductor foundry business posted substantial revenue growth, but TSMC still maintains its dominant market position. The upcoming presidential elections in Taiwan in January 2024 could impact the island's stance on sovereignty and its relationship with the United States. While Western interests align with Taiwan's independence, the outcome of the elections may influence this dynamic.
<br/>
Ensuring that TSMC remains at the forefront of semiconductor technology will be a key challenge for the winner of Taiwan's presidential election, given the evolving landscape of the global semiconductor industry.

# ***UK’s semiconductor and data centre industries set for rapid growth as copper and steel prices moderate***
<br/>
A new report from Linesight, a London construction consultancy services, indicates rapid growth prospects for several key sectors in the UK, including semiconductors, data centers, life sciences, and renewable energy. These projections come as commodities moderate and create opportunities and challenges for various industries.
<br/>
The UK government's commitment to invest £1 billion in making the country a technological superpower includes a £100 million expenditure on key chip components. This investment aims to boost the semiconductor industry, which is expected to grow by 4.1% in 2023. However, there are concerns about the impact of volatile construction material prices, particularly steel and copper, on chip production costs.
<br/>
In the data center sector, exponential growth is predicted, driven by advancements in AI, 5G, and IoT technologies. To meet the increasing digital infrastructure demands, new sites, locations, and skilled labor will be required.
<br/>
The UK's National Semiconductor strategy, with substantial funding and support, is also contributing to growth projections. Several battery and semiconductor manufacturing projects, valued at over £10 billion, are in various stages of planning and execution.
<br/>
The renewable energy market is set to grow at a rate of 11.6% in 2023, driven by the UK infrastructure bank's planned £200 million investment in power storage technology. This aligns with the UK's goal of achieving 100% zero-carbon electricity generation by 2035.
<br/>
Lastly, the life sciences sector is experiencing steady growth, with biotech companies attracting increased venture investment. In Q2, these firms raised £338 million, marking a 31% increase from the previous quarter and a 22% rise from the same period the previous year.
<br/>
Overall, while commodities' price fluctuations present challenges, supported by government investments and solid implementation plans, these sectors are poised for substantial growth in the coming years.
