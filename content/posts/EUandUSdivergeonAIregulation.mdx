The U.S. adopts a highly distributed approach to AI risk management, with federal agencies adapting to AI without new legal authorities. A substantial investment has been made in non-regulatory infrastructure, including the development of an AI risk management framework, evaluations of facial recognition software, and extensive funding for AI research.
<br/>
In contrast, the EU employs a more comprehensive legislative framework tailored to specific digital landscapes. The EU intends to impose new requirements on high-risk AI in socioeconomic processes, government utilization of AI, and regulated consumer products incorporating AI systems. Additional legislation ensures public transparency and influence over the design of AI systems in social media and e-commerce platforms.
<br/>
While the EU and U.S. strategies share some conceptual alignment, endorsing a risk-based approach and the importance of international standards, their AI risk management regimes differ significantly. Discrepancies are particularly evident when it comes to specific AI applications in socioeconomic processes and online platforms.
<br/>
Recognizing the significance of collaboration, the EU-U.S. Trade and Technology Council serves as a platform for joint efforts in AI risk management. The council works towards a common understanding of metrics and methodologies for trustworthy AI, collaborates on international AI standards, and conducts research on emerging risks and applications of new AI technologies.
<br/>
The article presents policy recommendations to foster greater alignment between the EU and U.S. in AI risk management. These include executing federal agency AI regulatory plans in the U.S., ensuring flexibility in sectoral implementation of the EU AI Act, establishing a legal framework for online platform governance in the U.S., and deepening knowledge sharing between the EU and U.S. on multiple levels.
<br/>
Collaboration between the EU and the U.S. is of paramount importance in shaping the democratic governance of AI. A unified international approach to AI governance is essential to strengthen regulatory oversight, guide research endeavors, promote best practices, and enable the interoperability of tools for developing trustworthy AI.
<br/>
In conclusion, this article sheds light on the current approaches of the EU and U.S. to AI risk management, identifies areas of misalignment, and provides recommendations to enhance collaboration and alignment between the two. By working together, the EU and U.S. can pave the way for effective AI governance that safeguards societies while fostering innovation and technological advancement.
