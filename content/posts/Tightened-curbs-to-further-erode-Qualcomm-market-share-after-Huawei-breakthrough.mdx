# ***Qualcomm may be most affected by Huawei-SMIC collaboration, says DIGITIMES Research***
<br/>
Huawei's potential revival in the handset business could have significant repercussions for Qualcomm, MediaTek, and the broader semiconductor market. Due to US trade sanctions imposed on Huawei in 2020, the Chinese tech giant had been unable to access foreign foundry services for its chip production, impacting its smartphone business. However, recent developments suggest a turnaround.
<br/>
Huawei has initiated pre-orders for its Mate 60 Pro smartphone featuring an in-house developed 5G processor, signaling a possible resurgence. If Huawei can leverage its in-house chips to produce more 5G smartphones successfully, it may regain market share lost during the sanctions era, particularly in the fiercely competitive Chinese market where patriotic buying is common.
<br/>
This resurgence could spell trouble for Qualcomm and MediaTek, as their major customers could lose ground in the handset market, resulting in reduced demand for their chip solutions. Apple, which has absorbed some of Huawei's market share in high-end handsets, might also reduce its reliance on Qualcomm for baseband chips.
<br/>
Ironically, US firms like Qualcomm and Intel had lobbied the US government to relax the Huawei ban, primarily to protect their own orders from this major customer. However, Huawei's resurgence could shift the balance of power in the handset market.
<br/>
Overall, Huawei's potential comeback could reshape the smartphone chip industry, with domestic competitors and Apple benefiting from its previous market share decline. If Huawei successfully navigates the challenges posed by the sanctions, it may regain a significant foothold, potentially altering the competitive landscape in the global handset market.

# ***Reduced risk, regionalization become supply chain priorities, economics expert says***
<br/>
Supply chain priorities are shifting towards resiliency rather than just efficiency, driven by lessons learned during the pandemic. Rana Foroohar, an economic analyst at CNN and global business columnist for the Financial Times, discussed this transformation during an event at FreightWaves' Future of Supply Chain event in Cleveland.
<br/>
The shift towards supply chain resiliency involves moving from a "just-in-time" inventory approach to a "just-in-case" one, particularly due to geopolitical risks like the Russo-Ukrainian War and U.S.-China tensions. Companies are increasingly opting for regionalization to reduce risk, spurred by higher production costs in distant locations and a backlash against globalization. This trend applies not only to low-margin industries but also to higher-value products like semiconductors, electric vehicles, and lithium batteries.
<br/>
The frequency of disruptive events like the COVID-19 crisis and climate-related disasters is on the rise, necessitating a paradigm shift in sourcing and moving goods. Resilience is becoming a priority, even though it may increase operating costs.
<br/>
Governments are also adapting to this shift, with the U.S. government imposing tariffs on China and investing in infrastructure and domestic manufacturing. Supply chain interruptions are no longer rare "black swan" events but part of the new normal, occurring every 18 months to three years.
<br/>
Digital technologies like big data, IoT, and additive manufacturing are beginning to revolutionize supply chains. Foroohar believes this transformation is just beginning and will have a profound impact on the industry.
<br/>
The future of supply chains involves a balance between efficiency and resiliency, driven by a complex interplay of geopolitical, economic, and technological factors.

# ***Expectations grow for heightened US containment measures against China, says DIGITIMES Research***

<br/>
The Huawei Mate 60 Pro, featuring the Kirin 9000s chip manufactured by SMIC, has become a focal point amid US sanctions and US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo's visit to China. US sanctions have restricted Huawei from using TSMC's technology for chip production, leading to a partnership with SMIC. DIGITIMES Research suggests this alliance is logical, as Huawei excels in chip development, while SMIC boasts advanced manufacturing capabilities among Chinese foundries. Both companies are expected to enhance their IC design and chip manufacturing abilities.
<br/>
SMIC, though currently utilizing 5nm chips, has room for improvement through multiple immersion exposures by DUV. Whether they commercialize this technology is uncertain, but they can enhance yields and reduce costs by accumulating production experience, ensuring the continuous production of Huawei's advanced chips. The number of immersion DUV lithography systems SMIC can acquire will determine chip production volumes.
<br/>
Despite Japan and the Netherlands imposing export restrictions, ASML, a key chip-making equipment supplier, received a Dutch government license to ship systems to China, challenging US containment efforts. DIGITIMES Research sees this as a sign that China may have partially broken through US containment, prompting expectations of further US efforts to close loopholes. Future measures might include stricter restrictions on SMIC's chip production capabilities.
<br/>
The US could potentially bar ASML from shipping advanced tools to China via Foreign Direct Product Rules or by preventing technical, materials, and components support, expanding restrictions on SMIC's sub-40nm manufacturing capabilities. The situation remains fluid, and the US's response will be crucial in shaping the landscape of semiconductor development and international trade.
