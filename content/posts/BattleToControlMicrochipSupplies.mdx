Semiconductors have become as crucial as energy resources for global capitalism today. These microchips are the brain of modern economies, powering everything from cars and phones to energy systems. The supply and control of advanced microchips have become a significant battleground in the US-China trade war.
<br />
Author Chris Miller argues that semiconductors are more critical than energy resources for capital and nation-states. Unlike oil, chip production relies on a few companies and specific choke points. Therefore, chips' essentiality and difficulty to produce make them strategically important for all countries.
<br />
The semiconductor industry's rise was essential for American hegemony, with the US military being a significant early buyer of chips. Offshoring electronics production, especially in Taiwan, further strengthened American capitalism. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) emerged as a dominant player, responsible for a vast majority of global chips, making Taiwan indispensable to chip supply chains.
<br />
China's rapid growth as a technological powerhouse poses a threat to US hegemony, but the US still has an upper hand in the chip war, with allies in key positions. China's leverage comes from its massive consumer market, which American big tech relies on for revenues. The US has curtailed Chinese technology firms like Huawei through various means, including banning US chip-making products.
<br />
The close interdependence between nations has led to a concept termed "weaponized interdependence," where conflicts can arise due to the interconnectedness. A disruption in chip production, especially in Taiwan, could have severe economic consequences globally, comparable to pandemic lockdowns.
<br />
The battle for control over semiconductor production has become a critical aspect of modern geopolitical struggles, with chips' centrality making them a potential trigger for significant global disruptions.
