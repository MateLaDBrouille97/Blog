# ***How Much Metal is Used in Clean Energy Technology?***
<br/>

<br />
Clean energy systems, such as offshore and onshore wind farms, as well as solar photovoltaic (PV) installations, require significant amounts of metal for construction. Copper, zinc, manganese, chromium, nickel, rare earths, molybdenum, and silicon are among the metals used in clean energy technologies. Offshore wind farms require the largest amount of metals, with copper demand alone reaching around 8,000 kilograms per megawatt of energy. 
<br/>
Copper is a key metal for clean energy technologies due to its outstanding conductivity, versatility, and superior heat dissipation capabilities. It is also highly sustainable, with a recyclability rate of 100%, meaning it can be reused multiple times without any decline in performance. The construction of wind farms can require millions of pounds of copper.
<br/>
Zinc, the fourth most used metal worldwide, plays a crucial role in clean energy infrastructure by protecting iron and steel against corrosion. It is particularly important for the construction of solar panels and wind turbines, which are exposed to the elements. A 100MWh solar panel park requires 240 tonnes of zinc.
<br/>
As the world transitions to renewable energy sources, the demand for copper and zinc will continue to rise. Companies like Teck, one of the world's largest producers of copper and zinc, are dedicated to providing the metals essential for a low-carbon future.
<br/>
Overall, the growth of clean energy systems relies on the availability and sustainability of these essential minerals. Meeting the increasing demand for clean energy will require a steady supply of metals and a focus on their responsible sourcing and recycling to minimize environmental impact.

# ***The Worldâ€™s Top Cobalt Producing Countries***
<br/>
<Image src="/VCE-Top-Cobalt-Producers_July14.jpg" alt="" width={700} height={650} />
<br />
The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has long been the world's largest cobalt producer, accounting for 73% of global output in 2022. However, its dominance is expected to decrease to 57% by 2030 as Indonesia ramps up its cobalt production. Indonesia has become the second-largest cobalt producer, surpassing established producers like Australia and the Philippines. In 2022, Indonesia's cobalt production surged to almost 9,500 tonnes from 2,700 tonnes in 2021, with the potential to increase production by tenfold by 2030.
<br />
Global cobalt production reached 197,791 tonnes, with the DRC contributing just under 145,000 tonnes. The electric vehicle (EV) industry is the largest consumer of cobalt, accounting for approximately 40% of total demand. The exponential growth of the EV sector is expected to double global cobalt demand by 2030.
<br />
However, there are challenges in the cobalt industry. Plummeting cobalt prices and efforts to reduce its use in batteries have severely impacted the DRC. Cobalt prices fell almost 30% this year to $13.90 per pound. There are also concerns about artisanal cobalt mining in the DRC, which is associated with human rights abuses and child labor.
<br />
Despite efforts to substitute cobalt in battery applications, it is expected to remain a vital raw material for the entire battery supply chain in the near future. The demand for cobalt is forecasted to more than double by 2030 to 388,000 tonnes.

# ***Why Copper and Nickel Are the Key Metals for Energy Utopia***
<br/>

<br />
Copper and nickel are two key metals that are crucial for the energy transition and achieving a utopian energy future. Copper is essential for the transmission and distribution of clean electricity, while nickel is used in lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles (EVs) and energy storage systems.
<br />
Copper plays a vital role in various energy technologies. Electric vehicles contain an average of 53kg of copper in their wirings and components. Solar panels use 2.8 tonnes of copper per megawatt (MW) of installed capacity, and onshore wind turbines have 2.9 tonnes of copper per MW, while offshore wind turbines use 8 tonnes of copper per MW in undersea cables. Copper is also preferred for electric transmission and distribution networks due to its reliability and efficiency. The demand for copper from clean energy applications is projected to double by 2030, with EV batteries driving the growth.
<br />
Nickel is a key ingredient in lithium-ion batteries for EVs and stationary energy storage systems. Nickel-based cathodes offer higher energy density and longer driving ranges. By 2030, batteries could account for 41% of global nickel demand, compared to just 7% in 2021. Nickel-based cathodes, such as NMC and NCA, dominate the battery cathode chemistry market.
<br />
As more green technologies are deployed and the energy transition progresses, the demand for copper and nickel is expected to increase. These metals are not only essential for clean energy applications but also have existing industrial uses. Therefore, the future looks bright for copper and nickel as they play a critical role in shaping the energy utopia.
