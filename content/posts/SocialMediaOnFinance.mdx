A recent financial panic that started with a bank run and caused the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank has been the first financial panic in which social media, particularly Twitter, has played a significant role. 
While Twitter has provided useful information, including facts about Silicon Valley Bank's balance sheet and bank regulation failures, it has also been a source of dubious rumors and hysterical predictions.
Venture capitalists, investors, and company executives have called for government guarantees to protect Silicon Valley Bank depositors, even though most of SVB's deposits were not FDIC-insured. 
These tweets may have been made sincerely, but they were also made to protect the financial interests of those who tweeted them. 
They also stoked panic and made bank runs more likely.
Social media is now going to shape any financial crisis we go through, and it remains to be seen whether we are prepared for it. 
False or overheated claims can have a powerful effect in an environment where people are likely to act on fear and impulse, and can thus have a self-fulfilling effect. 
It is essential to distinguish between accurate and inaccurate information and to consider the source of any claims made on social media during a financial crisis.
