Norway's data protection authority, Datatilsynet, has called on the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) to make its emergency sanctions against Meta's Facebook and Instagram tracking and profiling of users for ad targeting without consent a permanent measure across the entire European Union (EU) single market. This move could potentially lead to a complete ban on Meta running tracking ads without consent across the EU if the EDPB agrees with the action.
<br/>
The situation originated when Datatilsynet issued a local ban on Meta's tracking practices in July, using the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to protect citizens' data. Despite a daily fine for non-compliance, Meta continued to defy the ban and sought a court injunction, which was ultimately rejected.
<br/>
The EDPB has now received Datatilsynet's request and will assess the file's completeness before initiating a two-week period to make an urgent binding decision. This development follows a series of legal disputes between Meta and EU authorities regarding the legality of its ad targeting practices.
<br/>
Meta has previously claimed various legal bases for its ad processing, including contractual necessity and legitimate interests, but these arguments have been rejected by EU authorities and courts. While Meta announced its intention to seek user consent for its tracking ads in August, it has yet to implement this change.
<br/>
The referral to the EDPB may put pressure on Meta to expedite the transition to consent-based advertising. In the future, Meta may need to abandon its consentless tracking practices in the EU single market, marking a significant shift away from the surveillance capitalism model it has employed for years. If the Irish Data Protection Commission, Meta's lead regulator in the EU, fails to act promptly, the EDPB may step in to enforce privacy rights across the EU.

# ***UK bolts US ‘data bridge’ deal onto EU-US Data Privacy Framework***
<br/>
The UK government has confirmed its participation in a transatlantic data transfer deal between the European Union (EU) and the United States, referred to as the "UK-U.S. data bridge." This extension builds on an agreement reached between the UK and the US in June, aiming to facilitate digital commerce by permitting the transfer of UK citizens' data to the US while ensuring adequate data protection in line with the UK's data protection standards (UK GDPR).
<br/>
The UK's need for its data-sharing arrangement with the US stemmed from its exit from the EU. Ironically, Brexit has led the UK to rely on a framework established by the EU, despite having no input during its negotiation.
<br/>
The UK-U.S. data bridge allows US companies certified under the EU framework to receive UK personal data through the Data Privacy Framework (DPF). This decision has been supported by the US Attorney General's designation of the UK as a "qualifying state" under Executive Order 14086, providing redress mechanisms for UK individuals whose data is accessed unlawfully by US authorities.
<br/>
However, concerns about the durability of the UK's arrangement arise due to challenges to the DPF within the EU. Data protection experts argue that it may not adequately protect EU citizens' data. The EU's previous two data transfer deals with the US were invalidated by the EU's top court in 2015 and 2020. If the DPF faces a similar fate, questions arise about the UK's bolt-on extension's future.
<br/>
Although the EU's court of justice no longer has jurisdiction in the UK, the UK's extension may survive due to its unique position. Additionally, the UK government's efforts to weaken domestic privacy standards further complicate the situation.
<br/>
The UK-U.S. data bridge represents another step in the UK's post-Brexit data sharing agreements, following the adequacy decision made with South Korea in July 2022.

# ***UK opens new chapter in digital regulation as parliament passes Online Safety Bill***
<br/>
The Online Safety Bill, a contentious piece of legislation in the UK, has passed through parliament and is on its way to becoming law. This bill aims to establish Ofcom as the main regulator for the internet and introduces a new framework for content moderation on online platforms and services. The government's primary objective with this legislation is to make the UK the safest place for online activity, especially for children.
<br/>
Under this legislation, Ofcom will have the authority to impose fines of up to 10% of a platform's annual turnover or up to £18 million for violations of the content moderation rules. The bill addresses various online safety concerns, including illegal content, violence, incitement of violence, suicide encouragement, disinformation, cyberbullying, and minors accessing adult material.
<br/>
Over the years, the bill has expanded in scope to encompass a wide range of online issues, including trolling, scam ads, deepfake porn, and animal cruelty. It has also raised concerns about its potential impact on web security and privacy due to its provisions allowing platforms to scan message content for illegal material. This has prompted concerns from end-to-end encrypted platforms and services.
<br/>
Critics of the bill argue that it may lead to mass age-gating of the UK internet, as platforms may require users to confirm their age to access certain content. Wikipedia's founder, Jimmy Wales, has expressed concerns about the bill as a form of state censorship, stating that it is "bad for human rights," "bad for internet safety," and "bad law."
<br/>
Balancing the demands of child safety advocates with the concerns of digital rights and civil liberties groups will be Ofcom's responsibility as the main regulator. There is also a general worry about the regulatory burden this legislation will place on the UK's digital economy, affecting not only major social media platforms but also smaller online services. Ofcom has welcomed the bill's passage and is preparing to consult on the standards tech firms must meet to address illegal online harms once the bill receives Royal Assent.

# ***UK’s competition watchdog drafts principles for ‘responsible’ generative AI***
<br/>
The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has released a preliminary review of generative AI, proposing seven principles to guide responsible development and use of foundation models (FMs). These principles aim to ensure consumer protection and healthy competition in the AI sector. The proposed principles include accountability for developers and deployers, ongoing access to key inputs, diversity in business models, choice for businesses in using FMs, flexibility to switch or use multiple FMs, preventing anti-competitive conduct, and transparency in informing consumers and businesses about FM-generated content risks.
<br/>
The CMA's review stems from the U.K. government's directive to regulators to examine AI's impact on their domains. The CMA's focus is on large-scale AI models that are adapted for downstream customer applications, playing a crucial role in the AI supply chain. While the CMA acknowledges the potential benefits of FMs, it also recognizes associated risks and the need to act swiftly.
<br/>
The regulator emphasizes that its approach is not to rush into regulation but to remain proactive and engage with various stakeholders, including AI labs, big firms, civil society, academics, and experts. It aims to foster discussions and collaboration to refine these principles and promote positive outcomes in the AI market.
<br/>
The CMA's proposed principles complement the U.K. government's AI principles, focusing specifically on competition and consumer protection. Notably, the CMA does not delve into issues like data security and privacy, as these fall under the purview of other regulators, such as the Information Commissioner's Office.
<br/>
The CMA acknowledges the challenges of balancing AI technology development with regulatory measures and urges targeted and evidence-based interventions when necessary. The regulator remains cautious about overregulation, emphasizing the need for measured and specific actions to address emerging AI developments.
<br/>
The CMA's preliminary review and proposed principles reflect a proactive approach to the responsible development of AI and the promotion of healthy competition while acknowledging the complexities and uncertainties surrounding AI's impact on markets. Further discussions and collaboration with stakeholders will shape the future regulatory framework for AI in the U.K.
