Causaly, a drug discovery AI startup, has secured $60 million in series B funding to expand its presence in the United States. With a total funding of $93 million to date, the London and San Francisco-based company aims to revolutionize biomedical research and analysis using its knowledge graph and generative AI solutions. By automating previously manual processes, Causaly enables researchers to synthesize and reference vast amounts of published research papers, leading to faster insights and data analysis. The company claims that its software provides a ten-fold increase in productivity, reducing research time from years to weeks.
<br/>
Causaly's goal is to help scientists uncover potential treatments for complex and unsolved diseases like Parkinson's, lung cancer, and multiple sclerosis. The company recognizes the importance of transparent and trustworthy AI systems in the scientific community. Its CEO, Yiannis Kiachopoulos, emphasized the need for reliable AI tools that science leaders can rely on to make evidence-driven decisions.
<br/>
With support from investors such as ICONIQ Growth, Index Ventures, Marathon Ventures, EBRD, and Pentech Ventures, Causaly aims to leverage recent advancements in AI to further enhance its software products while adhering to stringent medical regulations and best practices. The funding injection will enable the company to expand its footprint and continue its mission of making scientific knowledge more discoverable and actionable for research organizations.

The article discusses the intersection of generative AI and cybersecurity, highlighting the opportunities and risks associated with this technology. It mentions a story of a fraudulent payment attempt that was thwarted by an employee who recognized the scam due to the impersonator's inability to replicate the CEO's Scottish accent. However, as generative AI advances, attackers can create more sophisticated deepfakes, making it harder for employees to detect scams based on voice impersonation.
<br/>
The article emphasizes the need for organizations to be aware of the double-edged nature of AI in cybersecurity. While AI offers tremendous opportunities for innovation and automation, it also introduces new risks. AI can be utilized to augment cybersecurity efforts, improve code reviews, and enhance detection capabilities. However, it can also be leveraged by threat actors to craft more convincing phishing emails and automate attacks.
<br/>
The author suggests that cybersecurity teams should view AI from an intelligence standpoint to understand how attackers are leveraging the technology. Additionally, they should consider the implications of AI on areas such as evidence in legal proceedings and the security of AI models themselves.
<br/>
To mitigate risks, organizations should educate employees about AI risks, implement data protection measures, and establish governance procedures. The article mentions Johnson and Johnson's efforts to raise employees' digital acumen, build private environments for testing AI, and empower developers with the right tools to build security upfront.
<br/>
The article advocates for a balanced approach to AI adoption, where organizations embrace the benefits of the technology while proactively safeguarding against potential risks.
