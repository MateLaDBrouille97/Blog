Artificial Intelligence (AI) is notorious for its prodigious power usage and is considered a major contributor to global carbon emissions. 
The training of a single AI model is capable of consuming more electricity than what is used by 100 developed-world homes in a year. 
Despite the gravity of the situation, there is scant information about its energy consumption and the carbon emissions it produces. 
It is well-established that data centers reliant on coal or natural gas-fired plants emit higher levels of greenhouse gases than those powered by renewable energy sources. 
A cautionary tale from the crypto industry is worth noting, with Bitcoin criticized for its energy consumption, leading China to ban mining and New York to impose a two-year hiatus on new permits.
AI companies, such as OpenAI, are already working on AI programs like GPT-4, which must undergo frequent retraining to stay current with the ever-changing events in the world. 
These companies are also focused on energy-efficient measures to minimize the carbon footprint caused by their activities. 
Microsoft, Google, and Amazon have made carbon negative or neutral commitments, but there is still a lack of transparency regarding the emissions and energy consumption of AI. 
This is leading to a call for greater transparency and more effective environmental management practices.
