In today's digital landscape, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are vital for enabling seamless communication and data exchange among software applications. As APIs continue to proliferate, they have also become an attractive target for cybercriminals, posing significant cybersecurity challenges. API vulnerabilities, such as broken object-level authorization (BOLA), can allow attackers to manipulate data, making them a high-risk target.
<br/>
Reports from 2023 indicate a 137% increase in cyberattacks targeting APIs, with healthcare and manufacturing being prime targets due to the growth of IoT devices and systems. Key API security concerns include Zombie APIs (deprecated and vulnerable APIs), DDoS attacks, authentication bypass, data leakage, data exfiltration, and shadow APIs.
<br/>
APIs have transformed various industries, enabling interoperability, efficiency, and innovation. In healthcare, APIs facilitate data exchange, telemedicine, and remote patient monitoring, but inadequate security can lead to unauthorized data access. A breach at Quest Diagnostics exposed medical information for 11.9 million patients.
<br/>
Financial institutions use APIs to enhance services, but a 244% increase in API attacks was reported in 2022. Latitude Financial suffered a breach compromising 14 million records, highlighting the importance of API security, leading to regulatory updates.
<br/>
Tech companies leverage APIs for innovation, but managing numerous APIs from different sources poses security challenges. Dropbox faced a breach due to an exposed API, emphasizing the need for strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.
<br/>
Retailers rely on APIs for real-time inventory management and personalized recommendations. However, Peloton experienced a breach, exposing PII of customers.
<br/>
While APIs offer efficiency and innovation, their widespread use introduces cybersecurity risks. Organizations must implement robust security measures, including authentication, patching, encryption, and monitoring. Attack Surface Management is recommended to discover and inventory APIs, ensuring a proactive security stance. To safeguard against potential threats, organizations should continuously update their API security practices.

# ***Silent Skimmer: A Year-Long Web Skimming Campaign Targeting Online Payment Businesses***
<br/>
A financially motivated cyber campaign known as "Silent Skimmer" has been actively targeting online payment businesses across Asia Pacific, North America, and Latin America for over a year. The BlackBerry Research and Intelligence Team has been monitoring this campaign, attributing it to a Chinese-speaking actor. The primary objective of the campaign is to compromise payment checkout pages on web applications, particularly those hosted on Internet Information Services (IIS), in order to steal sensitive payment data.
<br/>
The attackers start by exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications and then use open-source tools and living-off-the-land techniques for privilege escalation, post-exploitation, and code execution. The attack chain culminates in the deployment of a PowerShell-based remote access trojan, allowing them to control the host remotely and connect to a remote server housing additional utilities.
<br/>
The ultimate goal is to infiltrate web servers and install a scraper on the payment checkout service via a web shell, discreetly capturing financial information entered by users. The attackers strategically select virtual private servers (VPS) for command-and-control (C2) based on the geographical location of their victims to avoid detection.
<br/>
Interestingly, the campaign appears opportunistic rather than targeted, as it focuses on a variety of industries and regions, exploiting common technology vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access and steal payment data.
<br/>
In a separate development, Sophos revealed a scam involving fake cryptocurrency investment schemes on dating apps like MeetMe. Scammers lure victims into investing in bogus schemes, netting millions in illicit profits. What sets this operation apart is the use of liquidity mining lures, promising users high returns for investment in a liquidity pool, without any need for malware or hacking; instead, the scammers rely on fraudulent websites and social engineering to deceive users into giving access to their wallets.
<br/>
These incidents highlight the ongoing threats in the cybersecurity landscape and the need for businesses and individuals to remain vigilant against evolving tactics employed by cybercriminals.

# ***BunnyLoader: New Malware-as-a-Service Threat Emerges in the Cybercrime Underground***
<br/>
Cybersecurity experts have uncovered a new malware-as-a-service (MaaS) threat called BunnyLoader being advertised on the dark web. BunnyLoader offers various malicious functionalities, including downloading and executing second-stage payloads, stealing browser credentials and system information, and running remote commands on infected machines. Notably, it incorporates a keylogger and a clipper function to monitor the clipboard for cryptocurrency wallet addresses, replacing them with attacker-controlled addresses.
<br/>
BunnyLoader, available for $250 with a lifetime license, has been under continuous development since its debut in September 2023, incorporating anti-sandbox and antivirus evasion techniques. Updates on September 15 and 27 addressed command-and-control issues and critical SQL injection flaws.
<br/>
A key selling point of BunnyLoader is its fileless loading feature, making it challenging for antivirus software to remove the malware. The malware's control panel allows buyers to monitor tasks, infection statistics, connected hosts, and stolen data logs. It also enables remote control of compromised machines.
<br/>
The initial access mechanism for BunnyLoader remains unclear. Once installed, it sets up persistence through Windows Registry changes and performs sandbox and virtual machine checks before initiating malicious behavior. This includes downloading and executing malware, running keyloggers and stealers, and redirecting cryptocurrency payments.
<br/>
Researchers noted BunnyLoader's continuous evolution and adaptation for successful cyber campaigns.
<br/>
In addition to BunnyLoader, another loader called MidgeDropper was discovered, likely distributed via phishing emails. The cybersecurity landscape has also seen the emergence of information stealers like Agniane Stealer and The-Murk-Stealer. While Agniane Stealer is available as a $50 monthly subscription, The-Murk-Stealer is accessible on GitHub, potentially inviting misuse by threat actors.
<br/>
Cybercriminals are not only introducing new malware services but also enhancing existing MaaS platforms to evade security tools. For example, the RedLine Stealer has evolved to employ a Windows Batch script, enabling attackers to remain undetected for longer periods.
<br/>
Overall, the cybersecurity landscape continues to evolve with cybercriminals constantly innovating and adapting their tactics to achieve their malicious goals.
