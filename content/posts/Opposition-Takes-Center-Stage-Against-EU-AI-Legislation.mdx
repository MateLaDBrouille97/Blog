<br/>
Major AI companies are pushing back against the European Union's draft Artificial Intelligence Act, despite their public support for regulation. Over 160 executives from companies like Renault and Meta signed an open letter expressing concerns that the proposed act could harm Europe's competitiveness and technological sovereignty without effectively addressing AI challenges.
<br/>
Notably, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who publicly advocates for global AI regulation, provided feedback on earlier drafts of the act. Some of his suggestions, such as not designating general-purpose AI systems like GPT-3 as "high risk," were integrated into the draft. This aligns OpenAI with other tech giants like Microsoft and Google, seeking to reduce regulatory burdens.
<br/>
The AI Act focuses on creating a "product safety framework" with four risk categories, imposing strict requirements for high-risk AI systems. These include biometric identification, critical infrastructure, education, access to services, law enforcement, and more. It also addresses bias and copyright issues within training data for foundation models like large language models (LLMs).
<br/>
The EU's approach has global implications, with countries like China, Brazil, Canada, and the United States considering similar regulations. The EU's tiered structure for risk-based scrutiny could set a standard worldwide. While the final impact remains uncertain, the EU AI Act aims to strike a balance between fostering innovation and ensuring safety, potentially becoming a template for AI regulation in the future.

# ***AI Chatbots Are The New Job Interviewers***
<br/>
Companies are increasingly turning to chatbots to streamline the job application process, particularly for positions like cashiers, warehouse workers, and customer service staff. These HR chatbots, like McDonald's Olivia or L'Oreal's Mya, are designed to sift through the high volume of applications and schedule interviews with potential candidates. However, the use of these chatbots is not without its challenges.
<br/>
Amanda Claypool's experience with chatbot recruiters highlights some of the issues at hand. Technical glitches can lead to frustrating scenarios, like scheduling interviews for unsuitable positions or sending applicants to unresponsive managers. Such situations not only waste time but can also tarnish the candidate's perception of the company.
<br/>
One major concern is bias. The data used to train these chatbots can carry hidden prejudices, potentially leading to discrimination during the hiring process. Additionally, the rigid nature of these bots may not accommodate individuals with disabilities or those who are not proficient in English.
<br/>
To address these concerns, some governments have introduced legislation to monitor and regulate the use of automation in hiring. New York City, for instance, now requires employers to audit their tools for gender and racial bias. Despite these challenges, many companies see chatbots as a cost-effective way to reduce the workload on human recruiters.
<br/>
However, experts caution that chatbots should not make hiring decisions independently. They emphasize the need for human oversight to ensure fair and inclusive hiring practices. While chatbots can help streamline the process, they should be seen as tools to assist recruiters rather than replace them. Ultimately, striking a balance between automation and human judgment remains a key challenge in the evolving landscape of job recruitment.
