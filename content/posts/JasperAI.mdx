# What is Jasper.AI ?
<br/>

Jasper.AI is an AI-based content creation tool that can create original content for blogs, social media, websites, and more.
The tool is easy to use and offers over 50 templates for different types of content.
The pricing is also affordable, making it a good option for small sites that need content at a low cost. However, the tool does have some drawbacks, including the fact that the content lacks "humanness" and can sound cookie-cutter.
Additionally, the AI gathers information from all over the internet and doesn't fact-check it, leading to inaccuracies and incorrect statistics.
Proofreading and editing are required to ensure that the content is accurate and relevant. While the tool is suitable for creating short-form content, it is not as intuitive as other AI writing tools and requires a significant learning curve for creating blog posts. 
The cost of the tool can also add up with the third-party fees, making it more expensive than hiring a copywriter.
