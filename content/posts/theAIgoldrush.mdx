The AI gold rush is driving a surge in demand for computing power and benefiting companies across the AI infrastructure supply chain. As AI systems become more sophisticated and computing-intensive, companies are investing in data centers, high-end servers, networking gear, and data storage systems to run their AI applications. 
<br/>
Chipmakers like Nvidia and AMD, which provide semiconductors for AI servers, are experiencing significant revenue growth and higher market valuations. 
<br/>
The demand for specialist chips known as graphics processing units (GPUs) is expected to increase by $10-15 billion in the next one or two years, according to UBS. Other beneficiaries include chip manufacturers like TSMC, networking equipment providers like Arista Networks, and server manufacturers like Wistron and Inventec. 
<br/>
Software providers are also thriving, with companies like Nvidia offering software platforms to maximize the performance of GPUs, and startups creating applications for data management and hosting large language models.
<br/>
The main customers for these software solutions are the cloud computing giants, such as Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft, which are projected to increase their capital spending on AI infrastructure. 
<br/>
Overall, the AI boom is driving growth and innovation in the AI infrastructure sector, creating opportunities for various companies involved in the supply chain.
