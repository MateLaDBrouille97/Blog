It's not often that you hear of a chatbot playing a role in clinical practice, but researchers at Cedars-Sinai have just published a study showing that AI chatbot, ChatGPT, has the potential to improve health outcomes for patients with cirrhosis and liver cancer.
<br />
As many of us know, cirrhosis and liver cancer can be complex and challenging to manage, which is why personalized education AI models like ChatGPT could be a game changer for patients. By providing easy-to-understand information about basic knowledge, lifestyle, and treatments for these conditions, patients can gain the knowledge they need to better manage their care.
<br />
But how accurate is ChatGPT's knowledge about cirrhosis and liver cancer? Investigators presented the AI model with 164 frequently asked questions in five categories, and the study showed that ChatGPT answered about 77% of the questions correctly, providing high levels of accuracy in 91 questions from a variety of categories.
<br />
While 75% of the responses for basic knowledge, treatment, and lifestyle were comprehensive or correct, but inadequate, 22% of responses for basic knowledge were "mixed with correct and incorrect data." The study showed that the AI model also provided practical and useful advice to patients and caregivers regarding the next steps adjusting to a new diagnosis, but the study left no doubt that advice from a physician was superior.
<br />
Despite its limitations, the study highlights ChatGPT's potential to play a role in clinical practice and help empower patients and improve health literacy for different populations. As Bob Woodward said, "The study shows that AI technology is advancing at an incredible pace, and it's exciting to see the potential benefits it could bring to patient care."
<br />
It's clear that AI technology is going to play an increasingly important role in healthcare, but it's important to remember that it can never replace the expertise of a physician. As Lester Holt said, "While it's exciting to see AI chatbots like ChatGPT improve health outcomes for patients with cirrhosis and liver cancer, it's crucial that patients continue to seek the guidance of medical professionals."
<br />
In conclusion, ChatGPT's potential to improve health outcomes for patients with cirrhosis and liver cancer is an exciting development in healthcare, but it's important to remember that it can never replace the expertise of a physician. As Louis Theroux said, "AI technology can be a valuable tool in healthcare, but it's essential that we use it responsibly and in conjunction with medical professionals to ensure the best possible outcomes for patients."
