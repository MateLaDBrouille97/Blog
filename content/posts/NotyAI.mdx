# What is Noty AI ?
<br/>

Noty.ai is a transcription and analytics tool designed for live meetings.
The tool can automatically transcribe Google Meet calls in multiple languages, including English, Spanish, French, German, and Portuguese.
The transcriptions include timecodes and speaker labels for easy reference.
The tool can generate meeting notes, summaries, and highlights with keywords and action items for English-speaking meetings.
The tool integrates with Google Docs, allowing users to review, edit, and save their transcriptions.
To use Noty.ai, users must install the Noty Extension and sign in using their Google account.
The extension can be pinned for quick access, and captions are automatically enabled.
Noty.ai also offers an Azure Hybrid Benefit for Linux, allowing users to bring their Red Hat and SUSE Linux subscriptions directly to Azure.
