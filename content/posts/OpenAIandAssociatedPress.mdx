<br/>
In a groundbreaking collaboration, OpenAI, a pioneer in generative AI, has partnered with the Associated Press (AP), one of the world's oldest and most prominent newswire services. This unique alliance marks the first time a major AI vendor has joined forces with a media outlet. The partnership involves OpenAI licensing text content from the AP archives to train its large language models (LLMs). In return, the AP will benefit from OpenAI's expertise and technology, although it clarified that it won't use generative AI for writing actual news stories.
<br/>
The deal holds significant importance for both parties. For the AP, it represents an opportunity to embrace generative AI and incorporate the depth of human-authored news intelligence into its operations. OpenAI, on the other hand, gains access to valuable news expertise from the AP to inform its language models. Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed publicly.
<br/>
Amid the partnership's positive prospects, both OpenAI and other generative AI vendors have faced criticism for scraping publicly available data without proper consent. However, the AP expressed its commitment to protecting copyright and valuing the news industry through this collaboration.
<br/>
The AP has previous experience with AI, having utilized it for various tasks, such as automating tedious processes, voice and video transcription, and AI-powered search functions. OpenAI's willingness to support journalists and learn from the AP reflects its dedication to fostering positive impacts on the news industry.
