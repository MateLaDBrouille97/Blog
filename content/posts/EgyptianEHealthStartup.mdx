With over 5 million patients and more than 50,000 healthcare providers on its platform, ***Vezeeta*** has become one of the largest e-health startups in the MENA region.
<br />
The ***healthcare*** ***industry*** in the MENA region has been ripe for digital disruption for some time now. With growing populations and a rising demand for healthcare services, traditional healthcare models have struggled to keep up. ***Vezeeta***'s digital platform addresses these issues by providing a more efficient and accessible way for patients to access healthcare services.

The new funding will allow ***Vezeeta*** to expand its services to new markets in the MENA region and improve its technology platform. This will help the startup to continue to innovate and provide even more value to patients and healthcare providers.
<br />
