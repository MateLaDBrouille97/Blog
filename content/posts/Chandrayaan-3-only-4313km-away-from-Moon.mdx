The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) successfully executed an orbit reduction maneuver on Chandrayaan-3, bringing the spacecraft 4,313km closer to the Moon. The next maneuver is scheduled for August 9, with further maneuvers planned until August 17 to refine the orbit. Chandrayaan-3's landing module, consisting of a lander and rover, will separate from the propulsion module after these maneuvers, leading to de-orbiting procedures. The spacecraft is set to attempt a soft landing on the Moon's surface on August 23. The lander and rover carry scientific payloads for mineralogy studies and seismic activity measurements, which could provide valuable insights into lunar evolution.

# ***As Chandrayaan-3's Vikram prepares to land, Isro looks at lunar orbit traffic***
<br/>

<br/>
The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is preparing to soft-land the Chandrayaan-3 lander, named Vikram, on the lunar surface. ISRO has conducted an in-depth analysis of the traffic around the Moon to manage future space missions effectively. The Chandrayaan-2 orbiter, already in lunar orbit since 2019, has undergone multiple collision avoidance maneuvers due to close approaches with other spacecraft. Chandrayaan-3, now at a distance of 1,437 km from the Moon's surface, has completed its third lunar-bound maneuver, including lunar orbit insertion.
<br/>
ISRO's chief, S Somanath, emphasized the importance of planning a proper touchdown for Vikram, even in case of sensor or engine failures. As lunar exploration gains renewed interest, ISRO expects more intensive activities around the Moon in the coming years, driven not only by scientific exploration but also by commercial endeavors.
<br/>
ISRO is focusing on ensuring the safety and sustainability of lunar operations, given the growing number of objects in lunar orbits. It is collaborating with international organizations like the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee to develop guidelines for safe operations in the lunar environment. The agency is performing critical analyses of lunar-bound maneuvers to assess potential collision risks with other lunar orbiters and aims to establish guidelines for sustainable space operations in the cislunar and lunar regions.

# ***Russia Will Launch Its First Mission to the Moon in Decades Tomorrow***
<br/>
Russia is preparing to launch its first lunar mission in almost fifty years, joining a new 21st-century race to the Moon's surface. The Luna-25 mission is set to take off from the Vostochny Cosmodrome in Russia's Far East, shortly after India launched its Chandrayaan-3 lunar lander. Both missions aim to land near the Moon's south pole around August 23, and it's uncertain which will reach the lunar surface first. Russia's previous lunar lander, Luna 24, touched down in 1976 and successfully sent samples back to Earth. China has been at the forefront of lunar exploration recently, landing on the far side of the Moon with its Chang'e-4 mission and returning samples with Chang'e-5.
<br/>
Both Russia and India are targeting the lunar south pole, an area rich in ice and minerals that could aid in sustaining life and supporting future missions. The Luna 25 lander carries a robotic arm to search for such resources and is expected to function for about a year. In contrast, Chandrayaan-3 plans to deploy a rover called Pragyan, designed to last only a few weeks due to the harsh lunar nights. Despite the missions' proximity, there's no risk of collision, as there is enough space for both on the Moon's surface. These missions mark a resumption of lunar exploration, following setbacks like the crash of Israel's Beresheet lander and Japan's Hakuto-R malfunction. The current race to the Moon includes NASA's Artemis Program, aiming to land humans on the lunar south pole in the coming decade.

# ***What Are The Chances Russia And India Land On The Moon At The Same Time This Month?***
<br/>

<br />
In a mini-race to the Moon, both Russia and India are gearing up for lunar missions that might coincide this month. The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) is preparing for the Chandrayaan-3 mission to land on the Moon's South Pole between August 23 and 24. Meanwhile, Roscosmos has announced the delayed Luna 25 mission's launch, set to take off around the same time as the Indian spacecraft.
<br/>
The target destination for both missions is the Moon's Southern Polar region, known for its water ice in shaded craters. Water is a valuable resource and holds significance for future space exploration endeavors, including the Chinese missions and the Artemis program aimed at human lunar exploration.
<br/>
ISRO's Chandrayaan-3, launched on July 14, has successfully completed orbital insertion and is now preparing for a lander and rover descent to the lunar surface. Despite past challenges, ISRO boasts a solid track record in exploration, combining efficiency and affordability.
<br/>
Luna 25, a Russian mission with a complex history of delays and setbacks, is set to launch from the Vostochny Cosmodrome on August 10. If all goes according to plan, Russia could potentially beat India to a lunar landing by August 23. However, the main objective for both nations is a successful landing, as the intricacies of this phase of the mission are challenging and perilous. The outcome of this lunar race will unfold in the coming days.

# ***New Lunar Showdown: India, Russia in race to Moonâ€™s South Pole***
<br/>

<br />
India and Russia are in a competitive race to become the first country to reach the Moon's south pole. India's Chandrayaan-3 mission, launched on July 14, aims to achieve this feat by landing at the Moon's southernmost point on August 23. This mission is India's second attempt after a previous one in 2019 failed to land successfully. However, Russia has announced its own mission named Luna-25, set to launch on August 11, targeting a lunar landing between August 21-23. Despite leaving Earth 28 days later than India, Russia hopes to reach its destination first.
<br/>
Both missions face challenges and delays. Luna-25's launch was initially scheduled for October 2021 but faced setbacks, and the European Space Agency's cooperation agreement with Russia collapsed due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. India's Chandrayaan-3 mission also experienced over a year of delay following the failure of Chandrayaan-2 in 2019. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) claims to have extensively addressed the errors that led to the previous failure.
<br/>
Both missions have distinct goals: Luna-25 aims to test new landing technologies, analyze surface samples, and conduct long-term research, while Chandrayaan-3 will focus on scientific experiments and data collection during a single lunar day. Regardless of the winner, the competition echoes the historical space race between the United States and the Soviet Union, highlighting the continuing pursuit of lunar exploration.
