It's 2023, and the cybersecurity landscape is more challenging than ever. With ransomware, phishing, and supply-chain attacks on the rise, cybersecurity teams are feeling the pressure. According to a recent survey conducted by Bitdefender, a leading cybersecurity company, 99% of cybersecurity professionals are concerned about the evolving threat landscape. Vulnerabilities and zero-days topped the list of worries, followed by supply-chain attacks, ransomware, and social engineering attacks. With over half of organizations experiencing a data breach in the past 12 months, and the average cost of a breach estimated at $4.35 million in the United States, the stakes are high.
<br />
Complexity is a major challenge for cybersecurity teams. As organizations increasingly rely on hybrid cloud, software supply chain, and SaaS apps, finding the right resources to manage cybersecurity becomes a daunting task. Budget constraints and hiring challenges due to the economic crisis further exacerbate the problem. Moreover, cybersecurity departments are often overwhelmed with multiple vendors, tools, and data sources, leading to difficulties in managing and coordinating security efforts.
<br />
Adding to the complexity, many organizations face challenges with their current security solutions. Over 40% of professionals surveyed reported that their security capabilities cannot be extended across multiple environments. Complexity, too many alerts, and a lack of cybersecurity skills within teams are cited as hindrances. In addition, more than half of the respondents reported that their organizations had purchased security tools that did not live up to the marketing hype.
<br />
However, amidst these challenges, there is a silver lining. The survey found that most IT leaders (74% of respondents) plan to increase their security budgets in 2023, despite the economic crisis and layoffs. In fact, US respondents showed an even higher intention to increase security budgets (78%), while European businesses showed slightly lower intentions (around 70%). Furthermore, three-quarters of security leaders globally indicated that they plan to onboard more security vendors in 2023.
<br />
So, what are the requirements for a security solution in 2023? According to the survey, proactive threat hunting is deemed necessary by 93% of respondents. Managed Security Service Providers (MSPs) are in high demand, as organizations seek 24x7 security coverage, access to security analyst expertise, and peace of mind. Managed Detection and Response (MDR) and Extended Detection and Response (XDR) solutions are identified as meeting these requirements, as they provide advanced attack prevention, detection, and remediation, as well as targeted and risk-based threat hunting by certified security experts.
<br />
The survey also highlighted the need for a change in mindset regarding cybersecurity responsibility. Cybersecurity is no longer the sole responsibility of IT, but should be a shared responsibility across the organization. Increasing security awareness among all employees is crucial, as human error is the primary cause of cybersecurity breaches (95% of breaches are caused by human error). Organizations need to focus on defending the human organizational aspect to enhance their cybersecurity posture.
<br />
As cybersecurity threats continue to escalate, organizations face significant challenges in managing their cybersecurity defenses. However, with a proactive approach, increased security budgets, and a change in mindset towards shared responsibility, organizations can better navigate the complex cybersecurity landscape of 2023 and safeguard their valuable digital assets. Stay vigilant, stay informed, and stay cyber-safe!
