Big Tech is emitting between 5 and 10 percent of all greenhouse gases on this planet, and yet, they're some of the biggest buyers of clean energy and are constantly pushing for the transition to clean energy. 
One of the biggest culprits in this environmental disaster is the manufacturing of semiconductors, which requires a ton of energy and resources.
That's why at the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference, 60 countries got together to form the Semiconductor Climate Consortium. 
The goal? To figure out a way to make semiconductors more sustainable and energy-efficient.
Most of the carbon emissions from semiconductors happen during the manufacturing process, specifically in the fabs or the heating/cooling/electricity appliances. 
The rest comes from upstream suppliers. 
If we can redesign the system, we can decrease these emissions and make semiconductors a net positive for climate change.
But the semiconductor industry is facing a few snags, such as supply chain issues caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and economic sanctions related to the Russian-Ukrainian war. 
These are making the industry's carbon footprint even worse.
To combat this, we need to extend the lifespan of electronic devices and design them with sustainability in mind instead of planned obsolescence. 
Doing this can improve the efficient use of chips and reduce carbon emissions from electronic waste, which has increased by a staggering 53 percent between 2014 and 2020, with 580 metric tons of carbon dioxide being emitted in 2020 alone.
