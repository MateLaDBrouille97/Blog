TikTok has been fined €345 million (~$379 million) by the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) for multiple breaches of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) related to its handling of children's data. The platform was found to have violated eight articles of the GDPR, including issues concerning data processing transparency, data minimization, data security, and the rights of data subjects, particularly minors.
<br/>
The breaches included setting child users' accounts to public by default, allowing anyone to view their content, enabling comments and certain features by default, and failing to adequately verify the identity of parents or guardians for family pairing. Although TikTok disagreed with the decision, it acknowledged implementing changes to its settings in the years leading up to the investigation.
<br/>
The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) supported the DPC's findings, emphasizing the importance of presenting privacy options objectively to users, especially children. While TikTok wasn't found in breach of age verification requirements, there were concerns about the effectiveness of the measures in place.
<br/>
TikTok now has three months to bring its data processing practices into compliance. The company is also under investigation for data exports, with a draft decision expected in 2024. This case highlights the increasing scrutiny of social media platforms' data practices, especially concerning the protection of minors' privacy.

# ***India points the way to digital access across Africa***
<br/>
The India Stack, a digital infrastructure enabling payments and biometric identification, has significantly impacted millions of Indians and is now hailed as a model for countries aiming to stimulate economic growth and achieve sustainable development goals. Implemented over the past decade, it has curbed corruption, improved tax efficiency, and empowered previously marginalized citizens in education, healthcare, and banking.
<br/>
The India Stack's open-source nature has allowed both the government and private companies to develop apps, verify citizens' identities, and facilitate payments and data transfers. Nearly every Indian adult now possesses a 12-digit biometric identity called Aadhaar, granting them access to services. The United Nations recognizes its role in addressing the COVID-19 crisis and advancing development.
<br/>
The World Bank is also investing in digital infrastructure improvement. Bill Gates supports the adoption of digital public infrastructure (DPI) across Africa, envisioning it as a means to include millions in the financial system, reduce corruption, especially in targeted payments, and enhance state efficiency. Rural women, in particular, stand to benefit by having savings accounts, leading to increased spending on education and savings.
<br/>
However, some concerns exist about DPI, such as the potential misuse of personal data by authoritarian governments. Critics argue that it may empower governments to further suppress or discriminate against certain citizens. Gates acknowledges these concerns but emphasizes the importance of competent governance to provide essential services.
<br/>
In Africa, while digital technologies have made strides, the continent lags in digital identification systems. DPI adoption could address this gap, enabling more efficient services and supporting economic competitiveness. Whether it ultimately realizes its potential will depend on careful implementation and safeguards against misuse of power and data.

# ***Nigeria: Professor Advocates for Digital Technology Use to Help Struggling Farmers Cope With Climate Change***
<br/>
Professor Adewale Dipeolu, from the Federal University of Agriculture in Abeokuta, Nigeria, is advocating for the adoption of digital technology to address the challenges faced by farmers in Nigeria, particularly in the context of climate change. The agricultural sector in Nigeria has been grappling with various issues, including climate change, erratic rainfall, soil erosion, pest outbreaks, and security concerns.
<br/>
Dipeolu's research, conducted in Imo, Ogun, and Kwara States, focuses on raising awareness among farmers about digital solutions for climate change and evaluating the affordability of these tools. The ultimate goal is to develop a mobile app that assists struggling farmers in implementing digital solutions to improve crop yields and local food production.
<br/>
Digital agriculture encompasses a wide range of technologies, including precision field mapping, digital sensors, drones, artificial intelligence, and robotics. These technologies enable farmers to accurately manage their fields, monitor soil conditions, detect diseases early on, and optimize planting and harvesting times. Robotics integration reduces the reliance on manual labor, enhancing efficiency.
<br/>
The adoption of digital agricultural technologies promises to improve resource utilization, sustainability, and crop yields, which is essential for feeding a growing population. Additionally, innovative solutions like the Sunzaun vertical solar system are being introduced to farms, allowing farmers to harness clean solar energy efficiently.
<br/>
Professor Dipeolu's advocacy for digital agriculture in Nigeria aims to empower farmers to adapt to climate change and improve their agricultural practices through the use of cutting-edge technologies, ultimately ensuring food security and sustainability.
