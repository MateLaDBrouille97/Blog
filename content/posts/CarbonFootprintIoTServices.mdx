As AI becomes more prevalent in IoT services, there is a growing need to balance energy and compute demands to achieve sustainable and resource-efficient IoT services. The deployment of AI-driven IoT services in edge computing settings brings challenges in terms of energy consumption and carbon emissions. The current state of IoT testing tools does not cater for the in-depth benchmarking of energy consumption and carbon emissions, leaving users uncertain about their AI-driven IoT services' environmental impact. In this article, we explore the need for testing energy- and carbon-aware AI-driven IoT services and present a framework for estimating energy consumption and carbon emissions during runtime.
<br />
The authors of the study propose a framework for estimating energy consumption during runtime by using existing profiling techniques in software engineering. The framework comprises two main components: an instrumentation tool that collects data on CPU usage, memory usage, network traffic, and an analysis tool that processes this data to estimate energy consumption. The methodology for estimating carbon emissions involves collecting data on the energy mix of the power grid, calculating the carbon intensity of each energy source, and using this information to estimate carbon emissions.
<br />
The study highlights some of the challenges and limitations in their approach, such as the need for accurate data on energy mix and carbon intensity. However, the proposed framework provides a starting point for developers to estimate the energy consumption and carbon emissions of their AI-driven IoT services. The integration of environmental testing into existing IoT testing suites can help developers achieve more sustainable and resource-efficient IoT services.
<br />
As the adoption of AI-driven IoT services increases, the need for energy- and carbon-aware testing becomes more critical. The proposed framework for estimating energy consumption and carbon emissions during runtime provides a starting point for developers to optimize their AI-driven IoT services' environmental impact. Further research is needed to optimize energy usage and reduce carbon footprints in AI-driven IoT services. The integration of environmental testing into existing IoT testing suites can provide users with a more comprehensive view of their IoT services' environmental impact. Balancing energy and compute demands is crucial to achieving sustainable and resource-efficient AI-driven IoT services.
