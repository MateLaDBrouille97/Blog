OpenAI has announced a significant reduction of 90% in the pricing of its ChatGPT API. 
This comes just months after the company had already reduced the price by 66% in the previous year. 
Although OpenAI has admitted that the new model is slightly inferior to its predecessor, 
it has claimed that the reduction in price has brought the effectiveness of the model to almost the same level as before while being significantly cheaper, only costing a fraction of the price. 
With such an affordable cost, the access to AI can be democratized across the world, albeit at the cost of increased AI bot traffic. 
Despite the price cut, OpenAI's revenue is expected to remain unaffected as the company's dedicated instances can handle a high volume of usage, which is expected to surge in the near future.
