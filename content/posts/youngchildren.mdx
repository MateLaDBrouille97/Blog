AI Singapore has recently launched a children's storybook titled "Daisy and her AI Friends," which aims to help lower primary pupils understand technology and its responsible usage. Sponsored by Meta, 10,000 free copies of the illustrated book will be distributed to low-income families, while public libraries will have them in stock, and they won't be available for sale.
<br />
The book revolves around Daisy, a computer with legs, who becomes lost on her first day of school since she can only speak in binary code. Daisy encounters various characters who teach her new tech-related concepts to help her find her way. The seven main characters' names are all based on the letters "AI." These characters are inspired by ten winning designs that emerged from a competition held for primary school pupils, with over 230 submissions. The book's illustrator, Tan Jia En, 21, drew elements from these winning designs to create the final appearances of the characters in the book. AI Singapore authored the book.
<br />
The storybook aims to instil the idea of responsible technology usage from an early age, which is crucial in the current digital age. Technology is omnipresent, and teaching kids how to use it effectively and responsibly is more important than ever before. The book takes a lighthearted and engaging approach to tech concepts, making it easy for children to comprehend and enjoy.
<br />
In conclusion, "Daisy and her AI Friends" is a delightful children's storybook that educates and entertains young readers while simultaneously teaching them responsible tech usage. It's an excellent way for parents to introduce technology to their children while also ensuring that they use it responsibly. AI Singapore's initiative is a commendable effort to bridge the gap between technology and education, and we hope to see more such initiatives in the future.
