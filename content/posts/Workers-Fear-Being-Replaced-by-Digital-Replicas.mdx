The rapid progress of artificial intelligence (AI) is causing concerns within Hollywood's stunt community, as the technology's potential to create lifelike "digital replicas" threatens to replace traditional stunt performers. While discussions about AI's impact on acting have been ongoing, the implications for stunt workers are now gaining attention. Stunt coordinators and performers are worried that AI-generated sequences, from car chases to shootouts, could eliminate the need for human involvement.
<br/>
Hollywood studios are employing advanced 3D "body scans" of stunt performers and background actors, raising fears that these scanned likenesses could be manipulated to create AI-driven avatars capable of mimicking any action or dialogue. This could render certain stunt performers unnecessary. Director Neill Blomkamp even envisions AI generating entire scenes, reshaping filmmaking by removing the need for traditional stunts and real-world locations.
<br/>
The Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA) strike and Hollywood writers' ongoing dispute highlight uncertainties about AI integration. SAG-AFTRA raises concerns about creating lifelike digital duplicates of performers without clear ownership, compensation, and consent.
<br/>
While AI has transformative potential, experts recognize that certain aspects of action filmmaking rely on the authenticity of human touch. Some advocate for a hybrid approach that combines AI, visual effects, and human performers to execute sequences too risky for traditional methods. This approach aims to preserve stunt performers' unique skills while utilizing AI to enhance cinematic experiences.
<br/>
The sentiment within the stunt community is a mix of concern and adaptability. While job displacement is possible, many acknowledge the evolving filmmaking landscape and the need to incorporate AI innovatively while maintaining the industry's artistry and authenticity. As Hollywood grapples with the interplay of technology and creativity, the role of AI in stunt work remains a topic of ongoing debate.

# ***MOVEit Hack: Massive Medical Data Breach Exposes Millions of Americans' Sensitive Health Info***
<br/>
Hackers exploited a zero-day vulnerability in the widely used MOVEit file transfer software to breach IBM's systems, causing a major data breach that shocked the healthcare sector. The incident exposed sensitive medical information of millions of Americans, sparking concerns about digital medical data security and privacy. Colorado's Department of Health Care Policy and Financing (HCPF) disclosed the breach, which affected over four million individuals.
<br/>
The breach occurred as IBM used MOVEit to transmit data files from HCPF. While Colorado's government systems remained unharmed, hackers gained unauthorized access to specific data within IBM's MOVEit tool. The stolen files contained personal and medical details such as names, birthdates, addresses, Social Security numbers, and health records.
<br/>
The incident highlighted the interconnectedness of organizations in managing sensitive data, underscoring the risk of massive data leaks due to vulnerabilities in seemingly innocuous software. This breach also accentuated the importance of cybersecurity across various industries, exposing shortcomings in healthcare data management and raising concerns about data security standards and individual privacy within the healthcare sector.
<br/>
Although authorities didn't link the breach to the Clop ransomware gang, the incident echoed the wider threat of cyberattacks on healthcare institutions. It followed other breaches involving the MOVEit Transfer program, affecting universities and academic staff. The breach emphasized the need for robust security measures in transmitting sensitive information using tools like MOVEit, as organizations often use it for handling large volumes of confidential data.
<br/>
Overall, the incident served as a wake-up call for enhanced cybersecurity practices in the healthcare industry and beyond, underlining the potential ramifications of software vulnerabilities on data security and individual privacy.

# ***ChatGPT Rising in Popularity: US Workers Embrace AI Chatbot Despite Employers’ Concerns***
<br/>
<Image src="/technology-it-artificial-intelligence-chatgpt.jpg" alt="" width={600} height={500} />
<br />
US workers are increasingly adopting ChatGPT to improve efficiency in handling routine tasks, despite concerns that led major companies like Microsoft and Google to restrict its use. A Reuters/Ipsos poll indicated that globally, businesses are considering ways to leverage ChatGPT's capabilities. The chatbot program employs generative AI to engage in conversations and address various prompts. However, security firms and corporations express worries about potential intellectual property and strategic information leaks linked to the technology.
<br/>
Numerous instances showcase individuals using ChatGPT for tasks like composing emails, summarizing documents, and conducting initial research. Around 28% of respondents in the poll reported regularly integrating ChatGPT into their professional activities. Surprisingly, only 22% indicated their employers explicitly approved external tool usage. The survey, involving 2,625 adults across the US, maintained a credibility interval of approximately two percentage points.
<br/>
Additionally, the poll revealed that 10% of respondents noted their employers had policies against external AI tool use, and roughly 25% were uncertain about their company's stance. OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, chose not to comment on potential employee usage consequences but emphasized in a blog post that data from corporate partners would only train the chatbot with consent.
<br/>
ChatGPT's rapid rise since its November launch has sparked both enthusiasm and concern. Privacy watchdogs scrutinize its data collection practices, raising debates about innovation versus individual privacy protection. Generated charts could be reviewed by external human assessors, but concerns persist about AI systems replicating absorbed training data, posing risks to proprietary information. Ben King, VP of Customer Trust at Okta, highlighted a lack of understanding among individuals regarding data usage in generative AI services, impacting businesses' assessment processes.
