# What is Perplexity AI ?
<br/>
Are you tired of spending hours searching the internet for answers to your burning questions? Look no further! Perplexity AI is here to revolutionize the way you seek information online. As a cutting-edge AI chat tool, Perplexity AI harnesses the power of advanced language processing and artificial intelligence to provide real-time answers, complete with sources, making it stand out from other chat bots like Chat GPT.
<br/>
With its sleek website interface reminiscent of Google, Perplexity AI makes it easy for users to input questions and receive accurate answers in a flash. But what sets Perplexity AI apart from the rest? One notable feature is its ability to display the sources of the information it provides. Gone are the days of blindly trusting information from chat bots without knowing where it came from. Perplexity AI takes transparency to the next level by providing sources, giving users peace of mind knowing they can verify the accuracy of the information they receive.
<br/>
One of the key advantages of Perplexity AI is its up-to-date information. Thanks to its advanced language processing capabilities powered by OpenAI's GPT-3 model, Perplexity AI stays current with the latest news and updates. For instance, when asked about the release date of the Samsung Galaxy S23, Perplexity AI was able to provide the correct answer, even though the smartphone had just been released this week. In contrast, other AI models like Chat GPT may have limited knowledge of events that occurred after 2021 and may not be able to provide sources for their information as extensively as Perplexity AI can.
<br/>
The brains behind Perplexity AI are a team of experts with impressive backgrounds in AI and machine learning. Hailing from companies like Quora, Meta, DeepMind, Google, and Databricks, the founders of Perplexity bring a wealth of experience to the table. Their expertise in building conversational AI systems that provide accurate and relevant information through citations truly sets Perplexity apart from other search engines and chatbot platforms.
<br/>
With recent funding, Perplexity is poised to continue its development and expansion to offer a compelling alternative to traditional search engines like Google. Its commitment to accuracy, transparency, and user-friendly interface make it a standout choice for those seeking reliable and efficient answers to their questions.
<br/>
