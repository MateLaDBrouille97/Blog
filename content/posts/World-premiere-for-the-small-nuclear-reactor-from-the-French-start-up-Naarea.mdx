Naarea, the winner of France's 2030 investment plan call for projects "Innovative Nuclear Reactors," is pioneering a groundbreaking small nuclear reactor concept. Their technology revolves around a molten salt reactor that generates energy from currently stored nuclear fuels, including depleted uranium. Jean-Luc Alexandre, the company's president and CEO, discussed their progress and approach in an interview.
<br/>
The small 40-megawatt reactor, roughly the size of a bus, can be placed in secure industrial areas without the need for water-based cooling systems, making it versatile in deployment. Its core innovation lies in the use of silicon carbide, a corrosion-resistant ceramic, which is combined with graphene, making it ideal for mass production.
<br/>
Naarea's unique approach is to provide energy usage rather than selling the technology itself. They aim to supply both heat and electricity, offering a carbon-free heating solution at 650°C, competing with natural gas. This flexibility appeals to industrial consumers looking to decarbonize their production processes.
<br/>
The company has also developed a "digital twin" of their microreactor, a collaborative digital platform that accelerates development, safety demonstration, and training. This innovative approach contributes to their goal of producing hundreds of reactors in series, as opposed to one or two large reactors.
<br/>
Safety remains paramount, with the reactor designed to be intrinsically self-regulating at high temperatures. Naarea is on track to have an operational prototype by 2030.
<br/>
In a competitive landscape of small modular reactors, Naarea sees collaboration, not competition, as the way forward to meet the growing demand for energy diversification and emissions reduction. Their success is attributed to their emphasis on swift experimentation to drive innovation from theory to practice.

# ***Bangladesh Joins The ‘Nuclear League’; Russia Transfers Fuel For Its Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant***
<br/>
On October 5th, Russia delivered uranium fuel to Bangladesh for its first nuclear power plant at Rooppur, overcoming U.S. sanctions imposed on Moscow following the Ukraine conflict. These sanctions had disrupted Bangladesh's nuclear power ambitions by hindering loan repayments in U.S. dollars, causing delays in the plant's construction. To bypass the sanctions, Bangladesh agreed to make payments exceeding $300 million in Chinese currency in April 2023. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina virtually oversaw the fuel transfer, emphasizing their countries' strong partnership.
<br/>
The Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant, financed 90% by Russia at a cost of $12.65 billion, commenced construction in 2017. Its first 1,200-megawatt unit is set to begin operations in the coming year, with both reactors expected to be fully operational by 2025. This marks a significant development for Bangladesh, which faces a rapidly growing demand for energy, with approximately 9% annual growth. The plant will make Bangladesh the third South Asian nation, after India and Pakistan, to harness nuclear power.
<br/>
This collaboration in nuclear energy is a result of a trilateral agreement between Russia, Bangladesh, and India. The Rooppur plant's cooperation with Russia has facilitated the sourcing of materials from the Indian industry.
<br/>
The fuel transfer coincides with U.S. efforts to press Bangladesh for "free and fair" elections, with the U.S. reserving the right to deny visas to individuals who hinder democratic processes. The relationship between the U.S. and Bangladesh has strained in recent times, with the U.S. advocating for opposition parties. Amid this backdrop, Bangladesh has chosen to repay part of the Russian loan in Chinese currency, citing U.S. sanctions as the cause of payment disruptions.
<br/>
Despite these challenges, Bangladesh's nuclear power project at Rooppur is moving forward, driven by its energy security needs, a growing population, and a desire to reduce carbon emissions, while Moscow and Dhaka continue to strengthen their historic alliance.

# ***EU countries consider scrapping part of energy reforms - document***
<br/>
European Union (EU) countries are facing a potential setback in their efforts to reform the EU's electricity market due to a dispute between France and Germany over state aid for power plants. The disagreement centers around whether governments should be allowed to offer state-backed, fixed-price power contracts to existing power plants and use excess revenues from these contracts to subsidize industries. France supports these subsidies for its nuclear power fleet, while central and eastern countries also back the proposal. However, Germany and others are opposed, fearing it could provide French industries with an unfair advantage.
<br/>
A draft compromise, authored by Spain, the current holder of the EU's rotating presidency, offers three options: removing the rules on these subsidies entirely, limiting how countries can use the revenue from power price subsidies, or allowing the European Commission to intervene and restrict a country's use of these funds if it distorts the single EU market. This marks the first time that countries are considering scrapping the rules altogether.
<br/>
If this part of the reform is not passed, it won't prohibit France and others from offering fixed-price power contracts, but it may make them more challenging to use, subject to EU state aid approval. The initial reform proposal by the European Commission aimed to shift power generators towards long-term, fixed-price contracts to shield consumers from short-term gas price fluctuations. However, the section related to state-backed power contracts may be deleted amid the ongoing dispute.
<br/>
EU ambassadors will discuss the proposal, and energy ministers have until October 17 to reach an agreement. The outcome will have implications for the EU's efforts to transition to cleaner energy sources and ensure a stable electricity market.
