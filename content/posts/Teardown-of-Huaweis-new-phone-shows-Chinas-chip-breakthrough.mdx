Huawei Technologies has unveiled its latest smartphone, the Mate 60 Pro, powered by a new Kirin 9000s chip manufactured using China's Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) advanced 7-nanometer technology. Analysis firm TechInsights reported this development, highlighting it as a significant step in China's efforts to establish a domestic chip ecosystem. This processor represents a notable achievement for SMIC, China's leading chipmaker, and demonstrates progress in the face of U.S. restrictions on Huawei's access to chipmaking tools since 2019.
<br/>
Despite these challenges, Huawei's Mate 60 Pro has garnered attention for its impressive capabilities, including the ability to make satellite calls and exceptional download speeds, as reported by Chinese buyers on social media. The launch coincided with a visit by U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, adding a political dimension to the unveiling. Analysts see this development as a defiant statement by Huawei, showcasing its self-reliance in chip manufacturing and potentially signaling a resurgence in the 5G smartphone industry.
<br/>
Dan Hutcheson of TechInsights views this achievement as a "slap in the face" to the U.S., highlighting the progress made by Huawei and SMIC independently. This event underscores China's determination to reduce its dependence on foreign technology and strengthen its semiconductor capabilities, making it a significant milestone in the ongoing tech competition between the United States and China.

# ***Europe's carmakers fret over China's EV prowess at Munich car show***
<br/>
European car manufacturers are facing a challenging battle to produce affordable electric vehicles (EVs) and catch up to China's leadership in developing cost-effective and consumer-friendly electric cars. At the IAA mobility show in Munich, industry executives expressed concerns about the growing dominance of Chinese EV makers in the European market. Sales of EVs in Europe surged by nearly 55% in the first seven months of 2023, accounting for around 13% of all car sales.
<br/>
To compete with Chinese EV manufacturers, European automakers are focusing on reducing manufacturing costs to lower prices. Renault CEO Luca de Meo stated that their upcoming R5 EV will be 25% to 30% cheaper than their electric Scenic and Megane models, aiming for price parity with Chinese competitors.
<br/>
Chinese EV companies like BYD, Nio, and Xpeng are expanding their presence in Europe, posing a significant challenge to European automakers. Chinese EVs accounted for 8% of new EV sales in Europe in 2023, up from 6% in the previous year.
<br/>
The Munich event featured a substantial presence of Asian companies, with a notable increase in Chinese exhibitors. German automotive industry leaders are concerned about losing competitiveness and emphasized the need for more significant investments in electrification. However, European automakers are also making efforts to catch up by focusing on reducing production costs and improving efficiency in their EV offerings.

# ***China lets Baidu, others launch ChatGPT-like bots to public; tech shares jump***
<br/>
Four Chinese tech companies, including Baidu and SenseTime, have introduced their artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots to the public following government approval, as part of China's efforts to expand the use of AI products and compete with the United States. Baidu, China's leading online search provider, announced that its AI chatbot, Ernie Bot, is now fully accessible to the public. SenseTime, another major player, made its chatbot, SenseChat, fully available for all users.
<br/>
Two AI startups, Baichuan Intelligent Technology and Zhipu AI, also unveiled similar public launches. In response to these announcements, shares in Baidu and SenseTime experienced gains in early Hong Kong trading, with increases of 3.1% and 2.7%, respectively, while the broader market was trading lower by 0.4%.
<br/>
China's government is actively promoting AI deployment, and these AI chatbots represent a step in that direction. The move is part of China's ongoing efforts to bolster its AI industry and compete with the United States in the global AI market. As these AI chatbots become more accessible to the public, they are likely to play an increasingly significant role in various sectors, including customer service, virtual assistants, and other AI-driven applications.

# ***Meta Takes Down Thousands of Accounts Involved in Disinformation Ops from China and Russia***
<br/>
Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, has revealed its successful disruption of two major covert influence campaigns originating from China and Russia, marking a significant effort to combat disinformation on its platforms. The Chinese operation, known as Spamouflage, involved over 7,700 Facebook accounts, 954 Pages, 15 Groups, and 15 Instagram accounts. These accounts, operated by individuals dispersed across China, focused on disseminating content related to China's Xinjiang province, criticism of Western foreign policies, and the Chinese government's critics. Meta linked some of the activity to individuals associated with Chinese law enforcement.
<br/>
Despite its extensive reach, Spamouflage's efforts seemed to have limited impact as they failed to gain substantial engagement within authentic communities on Meta's services. China responded by accusing certain entities of launching continuous disinformation campaigns against it and urged Meta to take action against such content.
<br/>
Meta also thwarted a Russian operation called Doppelganger, known for mimicking mainstream news outlets and government websites to publish fake articles aimed at undermining support for Ukraine. The operation expanded its targets to include the U.S. and Israel. Typosquatting was employed to create malicious domains, making enforcement challenging.
<br/>
Meta described Doppelganger as the most persistent Russian-origin operation it has dismantled since 2017 and disclosed the removal of networks targeting Turkish audiences. Additionally, research highlighted the use of generative AI models in promoting misinformation, exposing a botnet named Fox8 on Twitter that promoted blockchain-related content and fraudulent cryptocurrencies. These actions underscore Meta's ongoing efforts to combat disinformation and maintain the integrity of its platforms.

# ***Not only Huawei, but the whole Chinese industrial chain should overcome US sanctions***
<br/>
The Huawei Mate 60 Pro holds immense significance as it navigates through the barriers erected by US sanctions, potentially reshaping the global tech landscape. If this smartphone indeed lacks US-sanctioned technologies, it could undermine American chip profits and promote Chinese operating systems. This game-changing device not only boasts 5G capabilities but is also the world's first widely available smartphone with satellite calling features. Analysts anticipate global sales in the tens of millions, potentially propelling Huawei's annual smartphone sales to 40-50 million units.
<br/>
The Kirin 9000s chip opens doors for other Chinese smartphone brands to transition away from Qualcomm chips, further bolstering the HarmonyOS ecosystem. Even if some Chinese manufacturers continue to rely on American technology, their negotiating power will shift significantly. This situation challenges US hardliners advocating for relentless sanctions against China, revealing a significant loophole in their approach.
<br/>
To further tighten sanctions would be a risky gamble, demanding extensive expansions and deeper restrictions. This could harm US and Western companies and potentially fail to thwart the Kirin 9000s chip. The Huawei Mate 60 Pro underscores the inadequacy of the US's attempts to stifle China's high-tech development. Huawei, with its core technology and contributions to 5G infrastructure, has emerged as a formidable force capable of resisting sanctions and shaping the future of technology.
<br/>
This development signals a shift towards a more balanced and equitable global technology landscape, challenging the US's dominant position and its ability to dictate rules unilaterally. It reflects a future marked by increased freedom and fairness in the tech industry, where no single power holds absolute sway.

# ***Japanese investment in Israel fell by 20% in first half of 2023***
<br/>
Japanese investment in Israel declined by 20% in the first half of 2023, dropping from $586 million to $469 million compared to the same period in 2022, according to a study by the Harel-Hertz Investment House. Several factors contributed to this decline, including the war in Ukraine, rising raw material prices, Pacific tensions, and Japan's resource consolidation efforts. Additionally, the devaluation of the Yen and uncertainty surrounding Israel's judicial overhaul played roles in this decrease.
<br/>
Despite the decrease in investment, Japan's share of foreign funding in Israel increased to a record 17%, up from 12.8% in 2022, surpassing the 2021 peak of 15.8%. The number of Japanese investments remained stable at 34, compared to 38 in H1 2022 and 68 for the entire year of 2022. Half of these investments were initial investments by new firms, while strategic investments by industrial companies seeking technological advantages made up a significant portion.
<br/>
Japanese financial funds scaled back international activities and focused on domestic investments, while institutional investors in Israel showed interest in Fintech and Insurtech, accounting for 12% of total investment.
<br/>
Despite the decline, Harel-Hertz anticipates a recovery in investments in the coming year, particularly in Israeli security technology. The potential for a free trade agreement and a double taxation treaty upgrade may further bolster economic cooperation between the two countries.
