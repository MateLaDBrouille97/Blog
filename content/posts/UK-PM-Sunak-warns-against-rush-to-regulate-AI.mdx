British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has warned against rushing to regulate artificial intelligence (AI) before fully understanding its risks. In a speech ahead of a summit on AI safety, Sunak highlighted the potential dangers associated with AI, such as the facilitation of chemical or biological weapons, terrorist use, cyberattacks, and fraud. He argued that governments, not tech companies, should be responsible for assessing and mitigating these risks to national security.
<br/>
Sunak claimed that only nation states possess the power and legitimacy to protect their citizens from AI’s potential harm. However, he cautioned against swift regulation, stating that it is difficult to create effective laws for a technology that is not yet fully understood.
<br/>
Authorities worldwide are grappling with how to regulate AI, particularly as advanced systems like ChatGPT continue to expand. Sunak's AI Safety Summit aims to address the risks associated with cutting-edge AI systems that may pose unknown threats to public safety and security. The summit will advocate for an international statement on AI risks and establish an AI Safety Institute to evaluate and test new types of AI.
<br/> 
Additionally, Sunak proposed the creation of a global expert panel, modeled after the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, to study AI and produce a "State of AI Science" report. In summary, Sunak emphasized the importance of understanding and mitigating the risks of AI before implementing regulations, advocating for international collaboration and government responsibility in safeguarding against potential threats.

# ***New Push for AI Safety Standards: Tech Giants Join Forces***
<br/>
Microsoft, OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic have formed the Frontier Model Forum to address concerns surrounding the regulation and safety of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. The forum aims to fill a perceived gap in global regulation and has appointed Chris Meserole as its executive director. The forum is committed to investing $10 million in an AI safety fund. The tech giants have coined the term "frontier" to describe a subset of AI with advanced and unknown capabilities. The EU's AI Act is expected to be finalized early next year, and the UK will host the first global summit on AI safety.
<br/>
The forum will focus on addressing risks associated with AI, including its potential use in designing bioweapons and facilitating hacking of critical systems. The $10 million investment will support academic research in AI, the development of techniques to test AI systems for flaws and dangers, and the establishment of standards for technical risk assessments. The forum aims to operate as a non-profit initiative funded by industry members and will collaborate with other organizations to ensure global consistency in AI standards.
<br/>
The alliance between Microsoft, OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic reflects their shared commitment to advancing AI technologies safely while addressing societal concerns and potential risks. The Frontier Model Forum will play a crucial role in shaping AI regulation and safety standards, ensuring that AI systems are built and deployed safely in the future.

# ***United Nations creates advisory body to address AI governance***
<br/>
United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres made a groundbreaking announcement on Thursday, revealing the establishment of a distinguished advisory panel comprising 39 members. This panel's core mission is to grapple with the complex and critical issues surrounding the global governance of artificial intelligence (AI).
<br/>
The advisory body comprises an eclectic assembly of prominent figures from various spheres, transcending borders and industries. Notable members include tech titans such as Hiroaki Kitano, Sony's Chief Technology Officer, Mira Murati, the CTO of OpenAI, and Natasha Crampton, Chief Responsible AI Officer at Microsoft. Government representatives from countries spanning Spain to Saudi Arabia also join the panel, along with academics hailing from diverse nations, including the United States, Russia, and Japan.
<br/>
Secretary-General Guterres stressed the immense potential of AI for positive transformation while acknowledging the looming specter of malicious AI use, which could erode trust in institutions, destabilize social cohesion, and imperil democracy. This duality of AI's promise and peril has spurred international concern, prompting many nations to seek regulatory frameworks.
<br/>
This UN advisory body aims to bridge these gaps by issuing preliminary recommendations by year-end and finalizing them by summer 2024. The immediate objectives involve fostering a global consensus on AI risks and challenges and bolstering international cooperation for effective AI governance. The inaugural meeting of this panel is scheduled for October 27, ushering in a new era of concerted efforts to navigate the AI frontier.

# ***US-China tensions will slow global chip industry, TSMC founder says***
<br/>
Morris Chang, the visionary founder of the world's largest chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC), expressed concerns on Thursday regarding the escalating technological tensions between the United States and China, emphasizing their potential to impede the global chip industry's progress.
<br/>
Speaking at an event hosted by the Asia Society in New York, Chang, whose entrepreneurial prowess in the late 1980s catapulted TSMC into a pivotal role, highlighted how the company played a vital role in transforming Taiwan into a dominant global force in advanced chip production.
<br/>
Recent U.S. actions have intensified the rift, as they imposed stricter export restrictions on chips and chipmaking equipment destined for China. These measures were triggered by Huawei Technologies' unveiling of a domestically manufactured chip, prompting further restrictions.
<br/>
Chang, at the age of 92, underscored the repercussions of isolating China's chip industry from the global supply chain, warning that such decoupling could have a ripple effect, impacting other international players. He noted, "I think that decoupling will ultimately slow down everybody. Of course, the immediate purpose is to slow China down, and I think it's doing that."
<br/>
Citing historical precedents, Chang expressed his unease, as previous economic conflicts between dominant and emerging powers have sometimes escalated into wars. He regarded the ongoing geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China as a confrontation between an established power and an emerging one, hoping it would not escalate further.
<br/>
Chang also commended the U.S. education system and remained optimistic about the nation, particularly as TSMC invests in chipmaking facilities in Arizona. A Chinese-born naturalized U.S. citizen since 1962, Morris Chang stands as a revered figure within an industry navigating treacherous geopolitical waters, affirming his faith in the United States as a beacon of hope for the world, despite its current challenges.
