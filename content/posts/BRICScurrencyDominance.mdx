The authors have used a mathematical model to determine a country's trade preference for a particular currency based on trade flows between countries and their relative weights in global international trade.
<br/>
According to the research, if only trade relations are taken into account, then there is a high probability that the BRICS currency will dominate international trade. The study has used data from the United Nations Comtrade database, which provides information on world trade networks associated with 194 UN countries during the decade 2010-2020. The three currency seed groups are formed by 9 eurozone countries for the euro, 5 Anglo-Saxon countries for the US dollar, and 5 BRICS countries for the new proposed currency.
<br/>
The authors have acknowledged that political factors such as sanctions or geopolitical tensions could affect this outcome. Additionally, they have noted that there may be other factors such as cultural ties or historical relationships that could influence a country's preference for a particular currency.
<br/>
The mathematical model used in this research has determined a country's trade preference for one of the three currencies based on its trading partners' preferences and their relative weights in global international trade. The study has found that when using this model, there is a high probability that the BRICS currency will dominate international trade due to its strong presence in emerging markets.
<br/>
The study has also examined how changes in global economic conditions could affect each of these currencies' dominance. For example, if there were to be an economic crisis in Europe or North America, it could lead to an increase in demand for alternative currencies such as those supported by BRICS countries.
<br/>
It is worth noting that the study does not account for all the factors that may affect a country's currency preference. However, the insights provided by this research are valuable in understanding the prospects of a BRICS currency dominating international trade.
<br/>
The study suggests that if only trade relations are taken into account, there is a high probability that the BRICS currency will dominate international trade. However, the authors have noted that political factors and changes in global economic conditions could affect this outcome. Overall, this research provides a mathematical analysis that sheds light on the potential prospects of a BRICS currency dominating international trade.
