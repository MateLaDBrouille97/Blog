Scientists have utilized artificial intelligence (AI) to discover a new antibiotic called abaucin, which has shown promise in killing a dangerous superbug known as Acinetobacter baumannii. The researchers from Canada and the US used AI to narrow down thousands of potential chemicals to a few that could be tested in the laboratory. This breakthrough highlights the potential of AI in accelerating drug discovery and revolutionizing science and medicine.
<br/>
The rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, or superbugs, has created a pressing need for new drugs. Bacteria have been evolving resistance to existing antibiotics, making infections increasingly difficult to treat. Each year, over a million people die from infections that no longer respond to available antibiotics. Acinetobacter baumannii is one of the most problematic superbugs, capable of infecting wounds and causing pneumonia. It is resistant to multiple antibiotics and is a major concern in hospitals and care facilities.
<br/>
To find a new antibiotic, the researchers trained the AI using thousands of drugs with known chemical structures. These drugs were tested on Acinetobacter baumannii to determine their effectiveness. The AI learned the chemical features that could target and combat the problematic bacterium. It was then deployed to analyze a list of 6,680 compounds with unknown efficacy. Within just an hour and a half, the AI generated a shortlist of potential antibiotics. The researchers tested 240 compounds in the laboratory and identified nine as potential candidates, including the highly potent antibiotic abaucin.
<br/>
Laboratory experiments demonstrated that abaucin effectively treated infected wounds in mice and successfully killed Acinetobacter baumannii samples from patients. However, further work is required to refine the drug in the laboratory and conduct clinical trials. The researchers estimate that AI-enabled antibiotics may not be available for prescription until around 2030. Interestingly, abaucin had no effect on other species of bacteria and specifically targeted Acinetobacter baumannii. This precision may reduce the emergence of drug resistance and minimize side effects compared to broad-spectrum antibiotics that indiscriminately kill bacteria.
<br/>
The power of AI lies in its ability to screen millions of potential compounds, a task that would be impractical to accomplish manually. By accelerating the discovery of new classes of antibiotics, AI has the potential to address the urgent need for novel drugs. The researchers previously tested AI-assisted antibiotic discovery on E. coli and have now shifted their focus to other challenging bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
<br/>
The implications of this breakthrough have garnered excitement from experts in the field. Prof James Collins from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology commented that the finding supports the idea that AI can significantly accelerate the search for novel antibiotics. Prof Dame Sally Davies, former chief medical officer for England and government envoy on anti-microbial resistance, described the use of AI as a game-changer and expressed optimism about the potential to save lives.
<br/>
Scientists have leveraged AI to identify a potent antibiotic called abaucin that can combat Acinetobacter baumannii, a dangerous superbug. The discovery showcases the potential of AI to accelerate drug discovery and revolutionize the field of science and medicine. While further research and testing are needed, the use of AI in antibiotic discovery holds promise for addressing the rising threat of antibiotic resistance and improving patient outcomes.
