Microsoft is facing a significant cybersecurity breach orchestrated by China-backed hackers, who stole a crucial key that allowed them to gain access to numerous email inboxes, including those belonging to several U.S. federal government agencies. Microsoft is still conducting an ongoing investigation and has not yet revealed how the hackers obtained the signing key used to forge authentication tokens, granting them unauthorized access to the inboxes.
<br/>
The group behind the breach, known as Storm-0558, has strong ties to China, but China has denied any involvement in the hacks. The cyber-espionage campaign started in mid-May and affected a small number of government accounts, with some unclassified email data being exfiltrated.
<br/>
Microsoft discovered that the hackers acquired one of its consumer signing keys, initially believing they used an enterprise signing key. The hackers used this consumer key to forge tokens, enabling them to break into enterprise inboxes. The incident led to Microsoft taking steps to block the hackers' activity and improve its key issuance systems' security.
<br/>
However, Microsoft is facing scrutiny for its handling of the breach, particularly its avoidance of terms like "zero-day" and questions regarding the lack of visibility into the intrusions by government departments themselves. Some government accounts lacked necessary security logging, hindering prompt detection of the attack. Microsoft's expanded disclosure provided more technical details for incident responders but raised further questions about the company's security measures.
<br/>
This breach poses a significant challenge for Microsoft, attracting attention from both cybersecurity experts and government agencies. The investigation and its fallout are likely to continue for some time.

### ***Chinese hackers raided US government email accounts by exploiting Microsoft cloud bug***

<br />
Chinese hackers belonging to the group Storm-0558 exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft's cloud email service to gain unauthorized access to approximately 25 email accounts, including those of U.S. government agencies and related consumer accounts associated with these organizations. Microsoft confirmed the breach and clarified that the targeted government agencies have not been identified publicly. The State Department was among the federal agencies compromised, and they alerted Microsoft to the breach.
<br/>
The hackers used Outlook Web Access in Exchange Online and Outlook.com to forge authentication tokens, granting them access to user accounts. Microsoft revealed that the group utilized an acquired Microsoft consumer signing key to forge the tokens, exploiting a validation issue to impersonate Azure AD users and access enterprise email accounts. The attack went undetected for about a month until customers noticed unusual mail activity and informed Microsoft.
<br/>
Although Microsoft stated that the attack was successfully mitigated and the hackers no longer have access to compromised accounts, it remains uncertain whether sensitive data was exfiltrated during the month-long intrusion. The U.S. cybersecurity agency CISA confirmed that the attackers accessed unclassified email data, and the FBI described the attack as a "targeted campaign" impacting "single-digit" government agencies. However, the U.S. government has not yet officially attributed the attack to China. CISA and the FBI urged organizations to report any suspicious activity in Microsoft 365 to their respective agencies.

### ***Mandiant says China-backed hackers exploited Barracuda zero-day to spy on governments***
<br/>

<br />
Security researchers from Mandiant have identified China-backed hackers as likely responsible for exploiting a security flaw in Barracuda Networks' email security gear. The hackers used the vulnerability to compromise hundreds of organizations, with about a third of the targets being government agencies. Mandiant believes this activity is part of an espionage campaign in support of the Chinese government.
<br/>
Barracuda Networks had discovered the security flaw in its Email Security Gateway (ESG) appliances and issued patches, but the hackers continued to exploit the flaw even after the patches were applied. As a result, Barracuda recommended that affected ESG appliances be replaced to ensure security.
<br/>
Mandiant attributes the hacks to a threat group it calls UNC4841, which shares similarities with other China-backed hacking groups in terms of infrastructure and malware code. The group used custom malware to maintain access to compromised devices and exfiltrate data.
<br/>
Mandiant found evidence that the hackers targeted email accounts of individuals working for governments with political or strategic interest to China, particularly during diplomatic meetings. This suggests an intelligence-gathering motivation rather than purely destructive attacks.
<br/>
Mandiant's Chief Technology Officer, Charles Carmakal, described the campaign as the "broadest cyber espionage campaign" by a China-backed group since the mass-exploitation of Microsoft Exchange servers in 2021.
<br/>
The Chinese Embassy in Washington D.C. denied the allegations, stating that the Chinese government opposes and cracks down on all forms of cyber hacking. They accused the U.S. government of engaging in similar espionage activities without providing evidence for their claims.
<br/>
In response to the situation, Barracuda advised affected customers to replace compromised devices to mitigate the threat.
