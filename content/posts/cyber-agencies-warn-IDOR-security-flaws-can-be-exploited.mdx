U.S. and Australian government cybersecurity agencies issued a joint advisory warning about the risks of insecure direct object references (IDORs) in websites and web applications. These vulnerabilities allow malicious hackers to access or alter sensitive data on an organization's servers due to inadequate security checks. IDORs are problematic because they can be exploited sequentially, enabling bad actors to access data they shouldn't be allowed to. The advisory highlights that IDORs can be abused "at scale" using automated tools, leading to large-scale data breaches.
<br/>
The agencies emphasized the importance of secure-by-design principles, urging developers to incorporate robust security measures throughout the software development process. They encouraged implementing authentication and authorization checks in web apps to reduce the prevalence of IDOR vulnerabilities.
<br/>
The advisory also mentioned several major data breaches caused by IDORs, including the exposure of medical documents, taxpayers' personal information, COVID-19 vaccination status, and sensitive health data. In the past, IDORs have led to mass data spills of mortgage documents, real-time location data of vehicles, and private phone data through a global stalkerware network.
<br/>
The warning serves as the first significant advisory on IDOR vulnerabilities, aiming to raise awareness and promote better protection of sensitive data in systems. The agencies emphasized the potential national impact of a single IDOR breach, affecting critical infrastructure, businesses, government, and individuals.

# ***Researchers claim US-registered cloud host facilitated state-backed cyberattacks***

Cybersecurity firm Halcyon has revealed that a little-known cloud company, Cloudzy, served as a command-and-control provider (C2P) for over two dozen state-sponsored hacking groups and commercial spyware operators. C2Ps are internet providers used by hackers to host servers and anonymized services for carrying out cyberattacks. Some of the prominent state-sponsored hacking groups relying on Cloudzy include China-backed APT10, North Korea's Kimsuky, and Kremlin-backed Turla, Nobelium, and FIN12. The latter was involved in ransomware attacks on the U.S. healthcare industry in 2020.
<br/>
Cloudzy also facilitated hacking groups from Iran, Pakistan, and Vietnam, along with Tel Aviv-based malware maker Candiru, which sells spyware to governments. Halcyon found that about half of the servers hosted by Cloudzy were directly supporting malicious activities. The firm suspects that Cloudzy is a cutout for AbrNOC, an Iranian cloud host, which could potentially lead to conflicts with U.S. government sanctions.
<br/>
Cloudzy, which claims to operate from New York City but is registered in Wyoming, requires only an email address and cryptocurrency payment for service. While the company's website claims to prohibit illegal activities, it also suggests that bad actors could potentially continue using the service by paying a fine. Attempts to contact Cloudzy and its CEO, Hannan Nozari, yielded no response. Nozari claimed he was not responsible for his customers' actions and stated that his company tried to remove malicious clients, estimating only 2% of its clients engaged in malicious activities.

# ***Mondee security lapse exposed flight itineraries and unencrypted credit card numbers***

<br />
Travel company Mondee experienced a data breach in which an exposed database leaked sensitive customer information, including detailed flight and hotel itineraries and unencrypted credit card numbers. The exposure was discovered by security researcher Anurag Sen, who alerted TechCrunch about the incident. The database was accessible without a password, making it vulnerable to anyone with its IP address or through an easily guessable subdomain of a Mondee subsidiary's website.
<br/>
The exposed data appeared to be related to Mondee's subsidiary, TripPro, a travel agent platform used by tens of thousands of booking agents and travel startups for self-service flight ticketing and hotel booking. The database, hosted on Oracle's cloud, contained personal information such as names, gender, dates of birth, home addresses, flight details, and passport numbers. Additionally, TechCrunch found full customer passenger name records (PNRs) and credit card information without encryption.
<br/>
The incident was first spotted in late July, but it is unclear how the database became publicly accessible. Mondee did not acknowledge the breach when contacted by TechCrunch, and the database was made inaccessible shortly after being notified.
<br/>
It remains uncertain if other malicious actors accessed the exposed data during the time it was accessible. TechCrunch inquired if Mondee had the technical means to determine if any data was accessed or stolen, but the company did not provide an answer. Mondee also did not reveal if it intends to notify affected customers about the data breach.

# ***Russia-backed hackers used Microsoft Teams to breach government agencies***
<br/>
<Image src="/GettyImages-1238862035.jpeg" alt="" width={600} height={500} />
<br />
Russian state-sponsored hackers, known as APT29 or Cozy Bear, targeted dozens of global organizations, including government agencies, in a highly targeted social engineering campaign. The group posed as technical support staff on Microsoft Teams to compromise the organizations. The hackers used previously compromised Microsoft 365 accounts to create new technical support-themed domains, from which they sent Microsoft Teams messages to manipulate users into granting approval for multifactor authentication prompts. Once granted, the hackers gained access to user accounts and exfiltrated sensitive information.
<br/>
The attacks began in late May and affected fewer than 40 unique global organizations. The targets included government agencies, non-government organizations, IT services, technology, discrete manufacturing, and media sectors. Microsoft has not disclosed the names of the targeted organizations but states that they indicate specific espionage objectives by the Russian hackers.
<br/>
Microsoft's investigation into the campaign has led to the mitigation of the hacking group from using the domains, but the company continues to investigate the activity. The hackers also employed precursory attacks to compromise legitimate Azure tenants and utilized homoglyph domains to impersonate legitimate domains in social engineering campaigns.
<br/>
This campaign is linked to the same Russian group involved in the infamous SolarWinds attack in 2020, and it is part of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, according to U.S. and U.K. law enforcement agencies. This incident highlights the ongoing threat posed by state-sponsored hacking groups targeting sensitive information across global organizations.
<br/>
Notably, this news comes shortly after Chinese hackers exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft's cloud email service to access the email accounts of U.S. government employees.
