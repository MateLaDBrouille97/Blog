# How Water Powers the World
<br/>
<Image src="/hydro.jpeg" alt="" width={800} height={700} />
<br/>
Hydropower is often overlooked in discussions about renewable energy, which tend to focus on solar and wind power. However, countries like Norway, Austria, and Canada generate a significant portion of their electricity from hydropower plants. In Africa and Latin America, countries such as the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Lesotho, and Ethiopia rely almost entirely on hydropower for their electricity needs. Venezuela, Ecuador, Guinea, Costa Rica, and Panama also heavily rely on hydropower. Despite its benefits, hydropower accounts for only 7% of the global energy mix due to the dominance of fossil fuels. Hydropower projects can also have negative environmental impacts, such as disrupting river ecosystems and displacing residents.

# Do you know how hydroelectric power plants work?
<br/>
<Image src="/HowHydropowerPlantsWork.jpg" alt="" width={800} height={700} />
<br/>
Hydroelectric power plants generate electricity by converting the kinetic energy of water into electrical energy. They consist of three main elements: the dam, which is the civil works infrastructure; the reservoir, which is a water storage facility; and the power plant, which contains the generators. The process involves forcing water through a hydraulic circuit, where its potential energy is transformed into kinetic energy. The kinetic energy is then converted into mechanical energy by a turbine, which is further transformed into electricity by a generator. Hydroelectric plants have high efficiency, capturing 90-95% of the water's potential energy. They offer advantages such as reusability, long lifespan, sustainability, flexibility, and low operating costs.

# The Evolution of Hydro Power Across the World
<br/>
<Image src="/Hydro-Infographic-Timeline_Resized.png" alt="" width={800} height={700} />
<br/>
The quest for renewable energy has been ongoing since the 18th century, when the modern understanding of electricity began to emerge. Inventors and innovators have been dedicated to finding more efficient ways of generating this valuable resource. By 2016, global renewable energy had reached an installed capacity of 2,011 GW. This timeline focuses on the development of hydropower, which is the subject of Part 2 in a series that explores renewable energy milestones worldwide. Part 1 of the series delves into solar energy advancements across the globe.

# Hydro Fact
<br/>
<Image src="/for_download_-_2018_hydropower_status_report_infographics_spread.png" alt="" width={800} height={700} />
<br/>
As of 2010, hydropower represents more than 88 percent of all renewable energy generated in the world, and continues to stand as one of the most viable sources of new renewable generation into the future. One-third of all countries generate at least 50% of their electric power from hydro. The U.S. Energy Information Administration predicts that 55% of the new global renewable energy production will come from hydroelectric plants by 2035.

# Visualizing the World’s Largest Hydroelectric Dams
<br/>
<Image src="/Largest_Hydro_Dams.jpg" alt="" width={800} height={700} />
<br/>
Hydroelectricity is the world's largest source of renewable energy, accounting for 40% of total capacity. It is generated by large dams that use water flow to spin turbines. The five largest hydroelectric dams in the world are China's Three Gorges Dam, Brazil/Paraguay's Itaipu Dam, China's Xiluodu Dam, Brazil's Belo Monte Dam, and Venezuela's Guri Dam. Three Gorges Dam has the highest installed capacity at 22.5 gigawatts (GW). Itaipu Dam produces a similar amount of electricity due to the Parana River's consistent flow. Compared to solar power plants, dams have higher installed capacities but similar costs per kilowatt-hour. However, dams have environmental concerns such as disrupting wildlife, degrading water quality, and causing earthquakes. Climate change also poses risks to hydropower.

Hydropower is a renewable energy source that converts flowing water into electricity. It can be generated through impoundment facilities, pumped storage facilities, or run-of-river facilities. The largest hydropower facilities in the US include Columbia River Power Stations, Hoover Dam, Ludington, Raccoon Mountain, Glen Canyon Dam, and Bath County. In 2017, hydropower had a total installed capacity of 103,000 MW, enough to power 103 million American homes. Hydroelectric power is the largest producer of renewable electricity in the US, accounting for 6.4% of the nation's total electricity in 2016. It has pros like cost competitiveness and reliability, but also cons like environmental impact and potential dam failures. The US Department of Energy aims to increase hydropower capacity by 50 GW by 2050 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create jobs.

<br/>
Hydropower has a rich history spanning over 2,000 years, with ancient Greeks using water to power grinding wheels. Today, hydropower is the world's largest renewable energy source, contributing 15.9% of global electricity, surpassing all other renewables combined. While solar power often grabs headlines, hydropower remains the most efficient and cost-effective method of generating electricity. Governments recognize its vital role in delivering affordable and clean energy, managing water resources, combating climate change, and improving livelihoods. Asia, particularly China, leads in hydropower capacity, with 42% of the world's total installed capacity. Hydropower not only provides renewable energy but also creates jobs and helps manage fresh water supplies.

<br/>
Hydropower is a widely used renewable energy technology that harnesses the power of flowing water to generate low-carbon electricity. With over 1.2 million megawatts of installed capacity globally, hydropower is the most widespread renewable energy source, accounting for 43% of total installed renewable capacity. It can provide both small-scale and large-scale power generation, from micro-power sources in remote areas to massive hydropower plants like China's Three Gorges Dam. In Malaysia, hydropower plays a significant role in the country's power generation landscape, with a total installed capacity of 6,275MW. It contributes to Malaysia's goal of achieving a 31% renewable share of power generation by 2025. Hydropower projects also have additional benefits, such as boosting local economies through activities like sport fishing and promoting eco-tourism. Furthermore, hydropower can provide essential electricity to communities, meeting their basic needs and enabling education.
