Collaboration and interaction are essential to creating and sharing new ideas. But what is the best way to collaborate? Recent research papers shed light on this question, exploring the importance of local collaboration and in-person interaction for deep engagement with new ideas.
<br />
The first paper, by van der Wouden and Youn, analyzes data from the Microsoft Academic Graph to investigate the transfer of knowledge between co-authors. The study finds that the probability of writing a solo-authored paper tagged with a new subdiscipline is higher after a local collaboration than a remote one. In other words, in-person collaboration leads to greater innovation and discovery.
<br />
The second paper, by Duede et al., surveyed thousands of academics across various fields to explore the relationship between geographic distance, intellectual distance, and learning. The results suggest that being close in space facilitates learning about ideas you wouldn't normally know about, and the strength of this relationship is stronger if the cited and citing paper are less similar to each other.
<br />
Taken together, these studies suggest that offline/in-person interaction might be better for forging deep engagement with new ideas. While remote collaboration has its benefits, there is something unique about face-to-face interaction that fosters creativity and learning.
<br />
So, what does this mean for tech developers and tech geeks from varying countries with a good level of education? It means that if you want to truly immerse yourself in a project or topic, you should consider finding ways to collaborate in person. Attend conferences and workshops, join local tech communities, and meet up with colleagues or collaborators whenever possible.
<br />
Of course, this isn't always possible, especially in a globalized world where remote work is becoming increasingly common. But even if you can't meet in person, try to find ways to simulate the benefits of face-to-face interaction. Schedule regular video chats or phone calls, use collaborative tools that allow for real-time communication, and make an effort to build personal connections with your colleagues and collaborators.
<br />
Ultimately, the key takeaway from these research papers is that collaboration and interaction are essential for deep engagement with new ideas. Whether you're working on a complex software project or exploring the latest advancements in artificial intelligence, finding ways to collaborate in person (or simulate the benefits of face-to-face interaction) can help you push the boundaries of what's possible and achieve greater levels of innovation and discovery.
