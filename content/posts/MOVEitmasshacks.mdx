Hackers have exploited a security vulnerability in the MOVEit file transfer tool, compromising the personal data of over 15.5 million individuals. The number of victim organizations affected by the Clop ransomware attacks continues to grow, with more than 140 known victims so far. Only 10 of these victims have confirmed the number of affected individuals, which already exceeds 15.5 million. Among the victims are Oregon driver's license holders (approximately 3.5 million), Louisiana residents (around 6 million), members of the California Public Employees' Retirement System (770,000), Genworth Finance clients (2.5 to 2.7 million), Wilton Reassurance insurance customers (approximately 1.5 million), Tennessee Consolidated Retirement System beneficiaries (over 170,000), and Talcott Resolution customers (over half a million).
<br/>
The mass-hacks also include the National Student Clearinghouse, a U.S. educational nonprofit working with thousands of schools. Additionally, seven known victims are U.S. universities, and 16 are U.S. public sector organizations, including the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which reported an exposure of over 100,000 individuals. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency revealed that several government agencies experienced intrusions related to the MOVEit transfer flaw.
<br/>
Clop, the group responsible for the attacks, has added numerous new victims to its leak site, including banks, consultancy and legal companies, and energy giants. Siemens Energy and the University of Californiaâ€“Los Angeles (UCLA) are among the targets. While UCLA has notified impacted individuals, the exact number of affected organizations and individuals remains unknown. Clop claims to have compromised "hundreds" of organizations, indicating that more victims may emerge in the coming weeks.
<br/>
In response to the attacks, the U.S. State Department has offered a $10 million reward for information on the Clop ransomware group. The group has previously targeted flaws in other file transfer tools, such as Fortra's GoAnywhere and Accellion's file transfer application.

### ***TSMC confirms data breach after LockBit cyberattack on third-party supplier ***
<br/>

<br />
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world's largest contract chipmaker, has confirmed a data breach after being targeted by the LockBit ransomware gang. The Russia-linked gang listed TSMC on its dark web leak site and demanded a $70 million ransom, threatening to publish the stolen data if not paid. TSMC commands 60% of the global foundry market, making it a significant target. Although the gang did not provide evidence of the stolen data, it claimed to have access to network entry points, passwords, and logins.
<br/>
A TSMC spokesperson confirmed the cybersecurity incident but stated that it did not impact the company's business operations or compromise customer information. The breach was traced back to TSMC's IT hardware supplier, Kinmax Technology. TSMC immediately terminated data exchange with Kinmax and emphasized its adherence to security protocols and standard operating procedures.
<br/>
Kinmax Technology, in a notice, apologized to affected customers and disclosed that its internal testing environment was attacked, resulting in leaked information related to system installation preparations provided to customers as default configurations. It remains unclear how many customers, besides TSMC, were affected by the breach. Kinmax's partners include companies like Nvidia, HPE, Cisco, Microsoft, Citrix, and VMware, but none of them have responded to inquiries about the incident.
<br/>
This breach follows the arrest of a Russian national by the U.S. Justice Department for involvement in LockBit ransomware attacks. LockBit also claimed responsibility for a ransomware attack on Granules India, a major pharmaceutical company in India. The incident underscores the growing threat of ransomware attacks targeting high-profile organizations and the need for robust cybersecurity measures to protect sensitive data.

### ***Cyware lands $30M to modernize cybersecurity operations***

<br />
Cyware, a cybersecurity startup focused on helping enterprises enhance their security operations, has raised $30 million in a Series C funding round led by Ten Eleven Ventures. The round also saw participation from Advent International, Zscaler, Emerald Development Managers, Prelude, and Great Road Holdings, bringing Cyware's total funding to $73 million. 
<br/>
Founded in 2016 by Anuj Goel and Akshat Jain, Cyware aims to integrate threat intelligence, threat hunting, vulnerability management, and incident response through prebuilt workflows. The company provides a platform with both no-code and low-code capabilities, enabling security teams to automate their threat-combating applications. It facilitates real-time collaboration among teams, allowing them to share threat intelligence and respond to attacks effectively.
<br/>
Cyware operates a network that connects enterprise security teams with each other and with third-party threat data providers. This enables teams to receive threat intelligence directly from security vendors, software providers, and trusted tech companies. The platform employs AI to extract information from threat intelligence data, assess threat severity, and cluster similar threats together. It also generates reports with key insights, provides code suggestions for security orchestration, and creates detection rules and signatures for existing threat detection systems.
<br/>
Despite the challenging cybersecurity venture capital market, Cyware's recent funding round demonstrates the company's strength. In Q1 2023, cybersecurity VC funding dropped by 58% year-over-year, with deal flow reaching its lowest point in years. Cyware plans to utilize the funds to expand its go-to-market efforts, strengthen market presence, develop strategic partnerships, and enhance its channel business.
<br/>
Cyware's platform aims to reduce repetitive tasks, automate proactive threat prevention, and deliver timely information to CISOs and other C-suite managers through consolidated dashboards and reports. The company already serves a growing customer base consisting of Fortune 1000 companies, government agencies, and regulatory bodies. With its focus on scalability and performance, Cyware aims to help large security teams operationalize actionable threat intelligence and improve their response actions.

### ***Ransomware gang lists first victims of MOVEit mass-hacks, including US banks and universities***
<br/>
The ransomware gang known as Clop has started identifying the victims of their recent mass-hacks, which targeted a critical security vulnerability in the MOVEit Transfer file transfer tool used by corporations. Among the victims listed are several U.S. banks, universities, and organizations such as GreenShield Canada, Putnam Investments, and Shell. Although the exact number of victims is still unknown, Clop has released the first batch of organizations it claims to have hacked. The gang has not contacted the victims directly but instead posted a blackmail message on their dark web leak site. While no stolen data has been published yet, Clop has informed the victims that it possesses a significant amount of their data. The attacks are ongoing, and more victims are expected to be revealed in the future.
