Thermal energy storage (TES) is a technology that can play a crucial role in decarbonizing heat and supporting renewable energy generation stability, according to a report by McKinsey and the Long Duration Energy Storage (LDES) Council. 
TES is a method of storing thermal energy for later use, either as heat or cold, depending on the application. 
The stored thermal energy can be charged with renewable energy or waste heat and then discharged as clean, firm heat to users such as industrial plants or buildings.
The McKinsey and LDES report showed that TES has the potential to double global LDES capacity and reduce global system costs by up to $540 billion annually. 
The report emphasizes the importance of decarbonizing heat, which accounts for around half of global energy consumption. 
TES can help accelerate this process by enabling the use of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, to provide clean, firm heat to users even when the sun is not shining or the wind is not blowing.
There are various types of TES technologies, including sensible heat storage, latent heat storage, and thermochemical storage. 
Sensible heat storage involves the storage of heat in a material such as water or molten salt. 
Latent heat storage involves the storage of heat in a material that undergoes a phase change, such as the melting or solidification of a material. 
Thermochemical storage involves the storage of heat in a material that undergoes a chemical reaction.
Many TES technologies are already commercially available, and the LDES Council predicts that the unit capital cost of TES is expected to decline by 5%-30% between now and 2040.
TES has numerous applications, including in industrial plants and buildings. In industrial plants, TES can be used to store waste heat from industrial processes and then use it to provide heating or cooling to the plant when needed. 
This can help reduce energy costs and increase energy efficiency.
In buildings, TES can be used to store solar energy during the day and then use it to provide heating or cooling at night. 
This can help reduce energy bills and increase energy efficiency.
The future of TES looks bright, with the unit capital cost expected to decline and the potential for TES to become more widely adopted. 
TES has the potential to help accelerate the decarbonization of heat and support renewable energy generation stability, and its benefits are becoming more widely recognized.
In conclusion, TES is a technology that can play a crucial role in decarbonizing heat and supporting renewable energy generation stability. 
The McKinsey and LDES report highlights the potential benefits of TES, including its ability to double global LDES capacity and reduce global system costs by up to $540 billion.
