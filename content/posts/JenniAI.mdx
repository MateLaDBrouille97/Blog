# What is Jenni.AI ?
<br/>

Jenni.ai is an AI writing assistant that helps users improve their writing workflow, whether for essays, research papers, or lab reports. 
Jenni uses a combination of custom AI, GPT3, AI21, and current text analysis to generate high-quality content. 
Its key features include AI completion, plagiarism-free writing, citations, and text transformations. 
Jenni differs from other AI tools like Jasper or Copy in that it goes line by line rather than producing whole chunks of text, encouraging users to be actively involved in their writing. 
Jenni can benefit students, non-native English speakers, bloggers, content creators, public speakers, and business leaders. 
It helps users improve their grammar, sentence structure, word choice, and productivity. 
The tool is easy to use and its interface is similar to that of Google Docs.
