A recent survey conducted by The Verge in collaboration with Vox Media's Insights and Research team and The Circus consultancy firm aimed to understand people's thoughts, feelings, and fears about AI. The survey gathered responses from over 2,000 US adults, revealing both excitement and concerns about the emerging technology.

<br />
The survey found that while AI has gained widespread attention, actual usage of dedicated AI products remains limited. Younger users, particularly Millennials and Gen Z, are more likely to have experience with AI tools. However, many people are still unfamiliar with specific AI companies and startups.

<br />
Generative AI, which can generate text, images, and videos, has been the driving force behind recent advancements in the field. The survey showed that people are using AI primarily for search, brainstorming, and creative endeavors such as generating music, videos, and artwork. In every category, users reported that AI allowed them to create things they couldn't have otherwise.
<br/>
The survey also highlighted concerns surrounding AI art and its ethical implications. While most respondents believed that artists should be compensated when an AI tool clones their style, there was a desire to avoid limiting the capabilities of AI. Many respondents admitted to generating content in the style of well-known artists.

<br />
Overall, the survey demonstrated high expectations for AI's impact on society. The majority of respondents believed that AI would have a significant influence on society, surpassing the expectations for other emerging technologies such as electric vehicles and NFTs.
<br/>
The survey results also indicated a demand for better regulations and standards for AI development. Over three-quarters of respondents agreed that regulations and laws should be developed to govern AI's development.
<br/>
The survey provides valuable insights into public perceptions of AI, highlighting both the potential benefits and concerns associated with its widespread adoption.

AI is posing new challenges to the web as it overwhelms the internet's capacity for scale. Generative AI models can effortlessly produce large amounts of text and images, which can compete with existing platforms and users. Companies are scraping data from the web to generate machine-generated content that is cheap but less reliable. Platforms like Reddit, Wikipedia, and Stack Overflow are grappling with the use of AI-generated content. Google is experimenting with AI-generated summaries that could replace traditional search results, potentially damaging the web's ecosystem. The quality of AI-generated content is often poor and can be subtly incorrect, posing risks to the web's reliability.

### ***EU suggests breaking up Googleâ€™s ad business in preliminary antitrust ruling***
<br/>
The European Commission has filed an antitrust complaint against Google, accusing the company of abusing its dominant position in the digital advertising market. The regulator suggests that divestiture of certain parts of Google's business may be necessary if the charges are proven. This move targets the primary source of Google's revenue and represents a rare recommendation for divestiture at this stage of an investigation. The Commission's preliminary findings indicate that Google has favored its own ad exchange, thereby strengthening its position and charging high fees for its services. Google has disagreed with the Commission's position and will respond accordingly. If found guilty, Google could face fines and required business changes.
