Mistral AI, a Paris-based startup founded by alumni from Google's DeepMind and Meta, has secured $113 million in seed funding to compete with OpenAI in the development and application of large language models and generative AI. Led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, the funding round included participation from several prominent investors across Europe. Mistral AI aims to address the challenge of making AI more useful and plans to release its first text-based generative AI models in 2024.
<br/>
The co-founders of Mistral AI, Arthur Mensch, Timothée Lacroix, and Guillaume Lample, have backgrounds in artificial intelligence and recognized the potential for AI development to accelerate. They believe that while OpenAI is a major player, the proprietary approach dominant in the field creates an opportunity for a different approach centered on open-source solutions.
<br/>
Mistral AI intends to build models using publicly available data to avoid legal complications associated with training data. Additionally, the company plans to allow users to contribute their datasets, promoting an open-source culture. While some may consider open source a potential security concern, Mistral AI believes the benefits outweigh the risks and can be advantageous in the realm of security as well.
<br/>
The startup's primary focus is on enterprise customers rather than consumers. It aims to fill the market gap by providing tools and guidance to help enterprises leverage AI effectively. Although Mistral AI is a young company without customers or a product, investors like Lightspeed recognize the expertise and potential of the founding team, which includes individuals with experience in developing large language models.
<br/>
The funding received by Mistral AI is significant, as it indicates that AI startups are still able to attract venture capital despite the presence of tech giants like Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon in the field. Mistral AI plans to use the funding to assemble a world-class team and develop the best open-source models. The startup's ambition is to contribute to the global effort in shaping the future of AI and give France a prominent role in this domain.

### OpenAI, DeepMind and Anthropic to give UK early access to foundational models for AI safety research
<br/>
The UK government, led by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, has announced that OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic have committed to providing "early or priority access" to their AI models for research into evaluation and safety. This follows the government's plan to host a global AI safety summit later this year. Sunak has emphasized the importance of AI safety and pledged £100 million for an expert taskforce dedicated to AI safety research. The government aims to make the UK a global hub for AI safety regulation and research. While this collaboration has potential benefits, there are concerns about industry influence and the need for diverse perspectives in AI safety efforts.

### Europe takes another big step toward agreeing an AI rulebook
<br/>
The European Parliament has approved its negotiating mandate for the AI Act, marking a significant step towards establishing a unified set of regulations for artificial intelligence (AI) across the European Union (EU). The parliament supported an amended version of the Commission's proposal that expands the rulebook to ensure AI development in Europe adheres to EU values, including human oversight, privacy, transparency, and non-discrimination. The amendments include a ban on remote biometric surveillance, predictive policing, and the creation of facial recognition databases through untargeted scraping of images. The legislation also categorizes high-risk AI systems and imposes obligations on general purpose AI models, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT. The proposal will now enter trilogue discussions between the parliament and EU member states.
