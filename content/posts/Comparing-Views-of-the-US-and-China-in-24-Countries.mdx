The article discusses the changing views of the United States and China in 24 surveyed countries. Overall, the United States is viewed more positively than China, especially in high-income countries. However, both countries are seen positively in some aspects and negatively in others. 
<br/>
One aspect examined is foreign policy interference. While both countries are seen as prone to interfering in the affairs of other countries, the United States is more likely to be described this way. The difference in evaluations of their interference is plotted on a scale for each country. 
<br/>
Another aspect analyzed is whether the United States and China take each country's interests into account. More people across countries believe that the United States accounts for their country's interests compared to China. However, there are varying opinions on this issue among countries. 
<br/>
Differences are also observed between middle- and high-income countries. Middle-income countries generally evaluate the United States and China similarly, while high-income countries rate the United States higher than China in terms of accounting for other countries' interests. 
<br/>
The article also explores perceptions of the United States and China as the world's leading economic power. Most surveyed publics consider the United States to be the leading economy, and this perception is growing in many countries. However, some European countries see China as the leading economy. 
<br/>
Public opinion on investment from the United States and China is also examined. In general, U.S. investment is seen as more beneficial in countries such as Israel, Poland, India, Brazil, and Mexico. Only in Hungary and Nigeria is Chinese investment seen more favorably. 
<br/>
Perceptions of American and Chinese technology are discussed as well. Both countries are viewed as technological powerhouses, but there are some variations in ratings among countries. Israel and South Korea stand out for their favorable evaluations of American technology compared to Chinese technology. However, China's technological achievements are seen more positively in Latin American countries, while Asian countries give the United States more positive marks. 
<br/>
The quality and attributes of American and Chinese technology products are also evaluated. American products are generally seen as well-made, while views of Chinese products are more variable. American products are also seen as expensive, while views on Chinese products' prices are more divided. Views on data security differ, with people more likely to say that technology produced by American companies protects personal data compared to Chinese companies. 
<br/>
Ratings of the American and Chinese militaries are discussed as well. The American military is generally viewed more favorably than the Chinese military in most countries. However, in Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, both militaries are considered above average or the best. Israelis rate the United States' military very positively, with a significant gap in ratings compared to China's military. 
<br/>
Lastly, perceptions of American and Chinese entertainment are explored. U.S. entertainment is more likely to be seen as above average or the best compared to Chinese entertainment. However, China has become the world's largest film market, but American productions still dominate the global box office.
