 The demand for storage capacity is increasing at an unprecedented rate as data continues to grow. 
 Efficient and reliable data storage is essential for effective digital infrastructure along with computing power and network connectivity.
 By 2030, the world is expected to enter the yottabyte era, which means dealing with data quantities on the scale of a quadrillion gigabytes,
 and this places significant demands on storage capacity, requiring optimized storage functions to read, write and transmit data efficiently and reliably.
 The MEGA framework offers meaningful measurements to assess the potential effectiveness of data storage systems as a crucial element of modern digital infrastructure. 
 It comprises four dimensions: Magnitude, Efficiency, Groundwork, and Advancement. 
 Magnitude refers to Adequacy and Momentum, measuring the magnitude of storage capacity and growth of investment in storage capacity. 
 Efficiency refers to Balance and Agility, measuring the correlation of computing and storage power to the overall efficiency of digital infrastructure and the 
 proportion of high-performance flash memory in the system. Groundwork refers to the reliability of the system, in terms of its ability to prevent data loss and recover quickly after a disruption.
 Advancement refers to Greenness, focusing on energy efficiency and environmental impact, and Cutting-Edge, reflecting efforts to develop and incorporate technical research and new technologies.
 Data storage is a significant contributor to economic development, and its direct, indirect, and induced economic contributions are measurable. Recognizing the economic and social potential of data storage power,
 there is a need for an indicator system to analyze data storage power at the macroeconomic level. The MEGA framework can be applied to a survey of 20 countries, and Singapore, Colombia, and China ranked the highest in various dimensions.
 Data storage has a crucial role in building digital infrastructure to meet tomorrowâ€™s diverse digital workloads and power the digital economy. The government must foster a conducive environment in terms of policies, support programs, and 
 planning to move forward meaningfully.
