Earlier this year, the US government imposed sanctions against Russian cybercriminal Mikhail Matveev, who is accused of being involved in cyberattacks and ransomware operations. Matveev, who is allegedly linked to the Conti hacking group, played a significant role in the development and deployment of various ransomware variants. He was involved in high-profile attacks on Costa Rica and the Washington, D.C. police department. However, Matveev seems unaffected by the sanctions, stating that they make him "happy" and enhance his security because it prevents his deportation to the US for trial.
<br/>
Ransomware attacks have been increasing, particularly targeting vulnerable public sector organizations such as schools and hospitals. While there are no specific laws banning ransom payments in the US, the FBI advises against paying as it could encourage further attacks. Sanctions are one of the US government's tools against ransomware groups. They make it illegal for US entities to transact with a sanctioned individual or group, effectively preventing American victims from paying ransoms.
<br/>
However, there are criticisms of the effectiveness of sanctions. Many ransomware actors reside in countries like Russia, which has a history of allowing hackers to operate freely. Additionally, some ransomware gangs are adapting their tactics to avoid sanctions, and they are predicted to have a profitable year in 2023. Nevertheless, sanctions do make it more difficult for criminal organizations to profit from cyberattacks.
<br/>
There is also a risk that sanctions could inadvertently drive victims to conceal ransomware incidents and payments to avoid legal repercussions. Violating sanctions can lead to hefty fines and criminal prosecution for Americans involved.
<br/>
While it may seem that sanctions are not having a significant impact, they are a step in the right direction in combating the global ransomware threat. Greater international collaboration is needed to strengthen the effectiveness of sanctions and address the challenges posed by ransomware actors based in countries like Russia.

# ***Why ransomware victims canâ€™t stop paying off hackers***
<br/>
In September, MGM Resorts experienced a devastating ransomware attack that impacted operations at several of its well-known casino hotels in Las Vegas. The attack resulted in the shutdown of electronic payment systems, slot machines, ATMs, and paid parking systems, causing significant inconvenience for guests. Additionally, the hackers stole a large amount of customers' personal information from MGM's servers. Despite the attack, MGM refused to pay the attackers' ransom demand. The exact amount of the ransom is unknown, but it is likely to be less than the estimated $100 million in profit that the company expects to lose as a result of the cyberattack.
<br/>
While the MGM attack received widespread media attention, an earlier cyberattack on Caesars Entertainment went largely unnoticed. This was because Caesars chose to pay off the hackers in order to prevent the disclosure of stolen data. A survey by Splunk revealed that 83% of organizations admitted to paying hackers following a ransomware attack, with over half paying at least $100,000 to retrieve their data.
<br/>
Although paying the ransom may seem like the easiest option, it is not without risks. There is no guarantee that paying will result in the safe return of stolen data or that all copies of the data have been deleted. Even if payment is made, the compromised data remains so, and organizations cannot trust a criminal's word that the data will be deleted.
<br/>
Furthermore, paying a ransom increases the likelihood of future attacks. A study by Cybereason found that 80% of ransomware victims who paid the ransom were subsequently targeted with another attack, often demanding a higher ransom. Paying the ransom creates a financial incentive for hackers to continue their attacks.
<br/>
In addition to the potential risks and increased vulnerability to future attacks, paying a ransom to a group sanctioned by the U.S. government can lead to legal and criminal consequences. The U.S. Treasury warns that paying ransoms to sanctioned hacking and ransomware groups may violate U.S. sanctions laws and result in criminal prosecution.
<br/>
While paying the ransom demand may seem like the easiest and cheapest solution in the short term, organizations are likely to face greater consequences in the long run. It is important for companies to invest in comprehensive cybersecurity measures to prevent and mitigate the impact of ransomware attacks.

# ***Take an Offensive Approach to Password Security by Continuously Monitoring for Breached Passwords***
<br/>
Passwords play a crucial role in securing access to an organization's data, but they also come with vulnerabilities. The inconvenience of managing multiple credentials often leads users to resort to insecure practices, such as using easy-to-remember passwords or reusing the same password across different accounts. This password reuse is both common and risky, as it allows a compromised password from one system to be used to compromise another. This poses a significant problem, especially for businesses, as a breached password can provide cybercriminals with access to sensitive data and the potential to halt operations.
<br/>
Unfortunately, many organizations lack effective measures to prevent password reuse, often only taking action after a breach has occurred. End-users are unlikely to follow best practices on their own, preferring convenience over security. To mitigate this issue, organizations must implement security tools and policies that address the password reuse problem.
<br/>
While multi-factor authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security, it is not enough to fully protect against password reuse. MFA can be bypassed by attackers who already have the user's password. Instead, solutions like Specops Password Policy can help enforce stronger password policies in Active Directory environments and mitigate the risk of reused and compromised passwords. Specops Password Policy can block over 4 billion known and compromised passwords, continuously checks passwords against threats, and provides up-to-date breached password protection data.
<br/>
Enforcing robust password security is crucial to protect IT resources. Organizations should not wait until after a breach to address this issue but should take proactive steps to enforce stronger passwords. By implementing solutions like Specops Software, organizations can ensure stronger password policies, continuous checking for breached passwords, and secure authentication solutions. Taking these steps can help protect against password-based data breaches and safeguard critical information.
